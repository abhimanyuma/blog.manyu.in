I am Abhimanyu, called either Manyu or Coden depending on who I am talking to. 
I am a Masters Student at IIT Kanpur, who should have been done with his thesis by now
but as with many things in college, got a bit delayed. A geek, with interests in 
both Algorithms and the Web. I would be joining [HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com/)
once I am done with my thesis, where I hope to "Learn,Build,Break."
