I was one of the "Departmental Placement Coordinators" along with [Akhil Arora](https://www.facebook.com/arora.akhilcs) and also got placed in *Microsoft-Redmond Campus* and thought now that I am done with all the work would be a good time to share all the interesting experiences of placements, since the next batch is sitting for placements. 

# The CS Factor
Computer Science & Engineering is an oddity among the branches at IITs, in that the placements are often a case of not enough supply of students rather than demand. It seems for a while there is always going to be a demand of good programmers in the market. 

While most other Placement Co-ordinators were struggling with getting companies here, we had problem of making sure that we handled each and every company properly (thankfully a lot many of the CS companies were handled by the Overall Placement Co-ordinators). This meant, making sure as many companies as possible got to give their "Pre-Presentation Talks" and push their brand in very visibily. Yet due to the limited number of slots available for them, we had to turn down a few companies, and we were very unhappy about the fact, even more so since, few of the companies had planned on it big. 

I am not sure what is currently happening in the industry, but do hope that the demand for programmers continue.

The major problems I saw on a larger scale were -

## Interesting Pre-placement Talks

PPTs atleast the ones I have attended are like a box of chocolates, you never know what your are getting. Some of the PPTs I saw have been amazing, in both getting the students to know the company, and doing it in a way that was awesome, some of them was successful at only one of them, while there were others that failed at both of them. 

## The Least Common Divisor Race to Complexity
All the IITs start their recruitement procedure on December 1<sup>st</sup>, the other activities like "Pre-placement Talks" and "Company Tests" may start  before that but the actual recruitement starts on December first, and called **The First Day** by many students. *To companies we assure you that unlike IIMs we do NOT have a zeroth day or a -n day.* The problem is that all the companies want to come on the first day, and as a result the first day gets so crowded that it becomes insane, to top it off. 

So the placement offices started slicing the day in itself, into **Slot 1** and **Slot 2** and if you are in IITB **Slot 3**, with the single greatest aim of squeezing in as many companies as possible. This also causes confusion since companies getting **Day 4** at IIT Kanpur, gets an equivalent slot that is the 5<sup>th</sup> one to IITB's **Day 2 - Slot 2** (IIT Kanpur has 2 slots on Day 1, and 1 slot per day afterwards, but IITB as far as I know has 3 on first day and 2 on second day. ) Finally what has happened is a solution that is bad for 

+ Students - since they have too many companies in one day, and actually gets brain fucked or brain dead. They also have to from the moment they enter the interview hit it off, since the time constraint robs them of second chance.  
+ Companies - since they don't get to spend enough time with the students, and take an interview as they like. The interviewers are always left midway since the time runs out. 
+ Placement Office - since this is a logistics nightmare, and even under good organizations, mishaps happen, and as is seen the schedules get broken and almost the entire process happens in a haphazard manner. 

Yet we see that it is disadvantageous for any single IIT to break out of it, since many companies (especially the non-CS ones) have a fixed quota of recruitement seats, and they may get filled from other IITs that still subscribe to this. This is a clear example of ["Tragedy of the commons"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons), where it is in everyones interest to have longer slots, but yet the one person to do it, is affected adversely. 

## Detour - My Placement Experience
I still remember getting ready at 5:15 AM because I had my first interview at 6:00 AM in the morning.

At 6:10 AM I had my very first interview with "US Public Enemy No. 1" Goldman Sachs, and I was brain dead. The interviewer kept asking me about copy constructors in C++ and for some reason I still haven't been able to figure out, I kept talking to him about *overloading the equality operator* yes, inside the interview room I got confused with "=" and "==" and did NOT realize this, and then messed up a simple graph problem, and a probability one as well.  

By 7:15 AM I was like 
> What the fuck just happened 

In any case I got called by Morgan Stanley next, and in all honesty I was pretty much awake for the whole duration, and well, but somehow hadn't prepared well enough for the process and crashed and burned. I got to know I didn't make it in Morgan pretty soon, and hence by about 8:30 I was out of Morgan for sure, and pretty much sure I was out of GS, but for some reason, they kept asking us to wait, and wait, and wait, and wait. 

So in between I rush to Tower Research Capital interview, and surprisingly the first round goes really well. I am pretty happy with myself. It was a algo-puzzle rapid fire, and answer a decent number of problems in the time alloted of 45 minutes, problems tougher than what I faced in GS, but this time I crack them fast. 

Then I go back to GS, and wait and wait and wait because I have nothing much to do. Tower calls me back for second round, and this I have to say is one of the most intense interviews I have sat through, the questions are amazingly good, and I manage to crawl to the finish of 2 problems while in one, I have no clue what to do. 

Then at about 12:00 the results start to come in, and as was expected GS is a blank (in fact the people had known it at 7:00) and Tower too is negative as expected. 

So I go to room, have lunch, change from suit to normal formals, and get ready for Microsoft and come back and the process starts normally. 

The interviews go really well, and the MS process starts and each of the three interviews go much better than I expected to do, given that I hadn't slept for about 35+ hours. I am finally able to give an interview based on my strong points. 

So my interview process thankfully wraps up quite early and finally catch some some sleep happy that I got a job. 

## Test Fatigue

If someone were to ask me what is the single worst thing about placements I would say it is **Test Fatigue**, what I mean is for someone who gets placed on Day-5 this is what his day looks like from Day 2 onwards.

+ **0700 - 0900** - Tests
+ **0900 - 1300** - Interviews
+ **1400 - 1800** - More Interviews
+ **1930 - 2300** - PPT & Test for next day

This is after having given about 10-15 tests during the October-November period, and moreover there is very little difference between the test of the companies, there are about 5-6 different styles of tests for the 50-60 companies that do come and conduct tests. 

The process is extremely tiring on the students, and infact people who performed good on Day 1 and Day 2 sadly was missing even simple interview questions on Day 3, while a lot of others who had free days on the first two performed better. 

Once again everyone would benefit on better scheduling yet no one would benefit from being the only one doing it.
