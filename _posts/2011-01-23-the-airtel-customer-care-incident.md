My mom had a few tariff vows with Airtel after her second billing
plan pack expired, and she didn't know about it, and hence I called
customer care, and after going through the usual IVR system,
pressed the necessary button to talk to a Customer Care Executive,
but then was surprised to find this being read out to me,
"*All calls to the customer care representative will be charged at 50 Paise/3 Min and if you are agreeing with the same press 1 to continue or else press 2 to return to Main menu*".
This might be an old news for a significant many Airtel users but
for me it was something rather rude on Airtel's part. So after
clarifying the tariff vows of my mom, I asked them about this
incident, and they said it was a Govt. rule and so on, sincerely
not satisfied with the answer I went online, to TRAI's website but
after searching was unable to find anything supportive, but on the
other hand found various pointer to the idea that it should not be
charged.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
So I make a second call to customer care which goes as given below

<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more-->


<p style="text-align: justify;">
*Conversation (Only the essence has been retained, the conversation may be slightly different)*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Me : Why is Airtel charging me for customer service ?

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Airtel : TRAI Guidlines

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Me : Which guidlines, can you get me the reference number or the
guideline number.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A : TRAI Rules - Telecome Regulatory Authority of India

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Me: Yeah but is there somewhere where I can refer this, I mean some
guideline number or something.Because CVAS (Caller Value Added
Rules) specify that there should be a toll free customer care
number to check about CVAS options. In section 2.a.ii of inbound
CVAS calls to customer rules.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A : You can call 198 to report any complaints that is still
toll-free. (*Yet no mention of this in the IVR System).* It is
there on website you can check, on our website.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Me : Is there any reference number or anything

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A : Can you please hold the line for some time, Sir ?

<p style="text-align: justify;">
< A 2 minute wait (which cost about Re. 0.33)\>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A : Well currently I am unable to retrieve it for you, Sorry Sir .
It was there initially, but now I am unable to take it for you.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Me : Well okay so, do you mean to say that you HAVE to charge for
this thing.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A : This is a 1-1 customer service, hence we charge for quality.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Me: My question is do you HAVE to charge for this according to
government rules ?

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A : This is a service , 1-1 service, we provide you information so
we charge.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Me : My question is is the charging optional to the company,

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A : You will be charged.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Me : My question is, is the charging optional to the company, can
the company not charge ?

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A : Sorry I am unable to answer your call I will transfer this to
my Senior Executive, Please hold the line

<p style="text-align: justify;">
< A 50 Paise wait later \>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A: Thank you for waiting sir, yes.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Me : I wanted to ask if the charging was optional for the company.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A : Charging is as per TRAI rules, you can see it on our website.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Me : So it is according to TRAI rules and is compulsory ?

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A: Yes, TRAI has released regulations, you can check on the site,
you will be charged.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Me : My question is whether it is optional for the company, as in
can Airtel decide not to charge.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A : I am just one person here, according to company statements, we
charge for the Customer Care call, and this is according to the
TRAI guidlines. I do not know the rest. I am just one person, my
knowledge is limited.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Me : Ok then thank you.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
So that is it folks, Airtel is now using slightly painting the
rules in a new light, for their advantage.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This is what I feel happened.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Airtel moved it's complaint registration toll free number to 198.
Which was already there but people never used it since Customer
Care was information + complaint facility. So you could ask about
GPRS pack problems and then ask them for advice on various call
tariffs.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Now 121 was merely an information portal, and not a critical
factor, and hence a value added service can be made chargeable,
which they did.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
*My problem with all this*

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
    <li>
I don't think I should be charged to talk to Airtel to get
information on Airtel's services, which will in the end benefit
them.
</li>
    <li>
If they want to improve quality, they better involve more call
centre executives, and not weed out the not-so-important people by
charging for this service.
</li>
    <li>
In most cases customer service, and customer relations aren't about
money, it is about a implicit trust you have in the company, sadly
here it was broken. They may not have broken any rules but twisting
them and making them sound as if it is the government's fault is
not the way to go.
</li>
    <li>
Nothing is there on the website, as of now or else if it is there,
then it is in someway not in an easily findable location. The only
mention I got of the whole incident was as follow
<a title="Airtel Customer Service link" href="http://www.airtel.in/wps/wcm/connect/airtel.in/airtel.in/home/foryou/mobile/prepaid+services/reach+airtel/" target="_blank">here</a>
</li>
</ol>
bq. In case you are calling from Airtel mobile, please contact us
on 121 for queries like Scheme/Bill Plan/VAS Information ; on our
Toll free Customer Care Number 198 for complaints or service
requests like Provisioning, Billing & Metering issues, Allocation
of Tariff Plan, Account Updation, ISD, STD, Roaming Activation, VAS
Deactivation, Service Termination, Security deposit Refund.
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Even that doesn't mention about it being chargeable but reference
to the other number as toll free is the give away.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The question I have to Airtel are :

<ol>
    <li>
Why suddenly such a move ? That too at a time of MNP ?
</li>
    <li>
Is it to reduce unwanted calls to Customer Care, or to somehow make
Airtel more exclusive ?
</li>
    <li>
Don't you think Customer Information is something you need to give
for free ?
</li>
    <li>
If you could do a multi million dollar re-branding exercise,
couldn't you have invested a bit more in Customer Care Call Centres
and improved the facilities ??
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
So if any of you find any materials, proving it either way please
do share as a comment, it might happen even though unlikely that
there is a govt. rule like that, and hence I may be wrong.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I have decided one thing for certain, once I get home after my
exams, I am going to use MNP to shiftÂ  my mom's connection to
someone who cares about Customer Care, and normal people.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally let me sign off with a quote by Mahatma Gandhi

bq. A customer is the most important visitor on our premises. He is
not dependent on us.We are dependent on him. He is not an
interruption of our work. He is the purpose of it. He is not an
outsider of our business. He is part of it. We are not doing him a
favour by serving him. He is doing us a favour by giving us the
opportunity to do so. Note : All what has been said above are my
personal opinion said after limited research, and in no way should
be taken as facts and bearing upon Airtel, this is just my personal
incident, and as such may be a stray case. This is not a complaint
against Airtel since legally I don't think they have done anything
wrong, but rather a comment on their ethics.
