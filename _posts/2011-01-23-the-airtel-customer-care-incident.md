My mom had a few tariff vows with Airtel after her second billing plan pack expired, and she didn't know about it, and hence I called customer care, and after going through the usual IVR system, pressed the necessary button to talk to a Customer Care Executive, but then was surprised to find this being read out to me,

> All calls to the customer care representative will be charged at 50 Paise/3 Min and if you are agreeing with the same press 1 to continue or else press 2 to return to Main menu

This might be an old news for a significant many Airtel users but for me it was something rather rude on Airtel's part. So after clarifying the tariff vows of my mom, I asked them about this incident, and they said it was a Govt. rule and so on, sincerely not satisfied with the answer I went online, to TRAI's website but after searching was unable to find anything supportive, but on the other hand found various pointer to the idea that it should not be charged.

So I make a second call to customer care which goes as given below

**Conversation (Only the essence has been retained, the conversation may be slightly different)**

> Me : Why is Airtel charging me for customer service ?
>
> Airtel : TRAI Guidlines
>
> Me : Which guidlines, can you get me the reference number or the guideline number.
>
> A : TRAI Rules - Telecome Regulatory Authority of India
>
> Me: Yeah but is there somewhere where I can refer this, I mean some guideline number or something.Because CVAS (Caller Value Added Rules) specify that there should be a toll free customer care number to check about CVAS options. In section 2.a.ii of inbound CVAS calls to customer rules.
>
> A : You can call 198 to report any complaints that is still toll-free. (*Yet no mention of this in the IVR System).* It is there on website you can check, on our website.
>
> Me : Is there any reference number or anything?
>
> A : Can you please hold the line for some time, Sir ?
>
> A 2 minute wait (which cost about Re. 0.33)
>
> A : Well currently I am unable to retrieve it for you, Sorry Sir. It was there initially, but now I am unable to take it for you.
>
> Me : Well okay so, do you mean to say that you HAVE to charge for this thing.
>
> A : This is a 1-1 customer service, hence we charge for quality.
>
> Me: My question is do you HAVE to charge for this according togovernment rules ?
>
> A : This is a service , 1-1 service, we provide you information so we charge.
>
> Me : My question is is the charging optional to the company,
>
> A : You will be charged.
>
> Me : My question is, is the charging optional to the company, can the company not charge ?
>
> A : Sorry I am unable to answer your call I will transfer this to
my Senior Executive, Please hold the line
>
> A 50 Paise wait later
>
> A: Thank you for waiting sir, yes.
>
> Me : I wanted to ask if the charging was optional for the company.
>
> A : Charging is as per TRAI rules, you can see it on our website.
>
> Me : So it is according to TRAI rules and is compulsory ?
>
> A: Yes, TRAI has released regulations, you can check on the site,you will be charged.
>
> Me : My question is whether it is optional for the company, as in
>
> A : I am just one person here, according to company statements, we charge for the Customer Care call, and this is according to the TRAI guidlines. I do not know the rest. I am just one person, my knowledge is limited.
>
> Me : Ok then thank you.


So that is it folks, Airtel is now using slightly painting the
rules in a new light, for their advantage.

This is what I feel happened.

- Airtel moved it's complaint registration toll free number to 198. Which was already there but people never used it since Customer Care was information + complaint facility. So you could ask about GPRS pack problems and then ask them for advice on various call tariffs.
- Now 121 was merely an information portal, and not a critical factor, and hence a value added service can be made chargeable, which they did.

## My problem with all this

I don't think I should be charged to talk to Airtel to get information on Airtel's services, which will in the end benefit them.

If they want to improve quality, they better involve more call centre executives, and not weed out the not-so-important people by charging for this service.

In most cases customer service, and customer relations aren't about money, it is about a implicit trust you have in the company, sadly here it was broken. They may not have broken any rules but twisting them and making them sound as if it is the government's fault is not the way to go.

Nothing is there on the website, as of now or else if it is there,then it is in someway not in an easily findable location. The only mention I got of the whole incident was as follow [here](http://www.airtel.in/wps/wcm/connect/airtel.in/airtel.in/home/foryou/mobile/prepaid+services/reach+airtel/) 

> In case you are calling from Airtel mobile, please contact us on 121 for queries like Scheme/Bill Plan/VAS Information; on our Toll free Customer Care Number 198 for complaints or service requests like Provisioning, Billing & Metering issues, Allocation of Tariff Plan, Account Updation, ISD, STD, Roaming Activation, VAS Deactivation, Service Termination, Security deposit Refund.

Even that doesn't mention about it being chargeable but reference to the other number as toll free is the give away.

The questions I have for Airtel are :

1. Why suddenly such a move ? That too at a time of MNP ?
2. Is it to reduce unwanted calls to Customer Care, or to somehow make Airtel more exclusive ?
3. Don't you think Customer Information is something you need to give for free ?
4. If you could do a multi million dollar re-branding exercise, couldn't you have invested a bit more in Customer Care Call Centres and improved the facilities ??


So if any of you find any materials, proving it either way please do share as a comment, it might happen even though unlikely that there is a govt. rule like that, and hence I may be wrong.

I have decided one thing for certain, once I get home after my exams, I am going to use MNP to shiftÂ  my mom's connection to someone who cares about Customer Care, and normal people.

Finally let me sign off with a quote by Mahatma Gandhi

> A customer is the most important visitor on our premises. He is not dependent on us.We are dependent on him. He is not an interruption of our work. He is the purpose of it. He is not an outsider of our business. He is part of it. We are not doing him a favour by serving him. He is doing us a favour by giving us the opportunity to do so.

 Note : All what has been said above are my personal opinion said after limited research, and in no way should be taken as facts and bearing upon Airtel, this is just my personal incident, and as such may be a stray case. This is not a complaint against Airtel since legally I don't think they have done anything wrong, but rather a comment on their ethics.
