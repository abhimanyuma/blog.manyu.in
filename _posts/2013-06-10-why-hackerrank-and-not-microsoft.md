I was asked on Quora why I joined [HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com) a startup in Bangalore, after receiving an offer from [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com). Reposting the answer here as well.

> So that someone could put up such a question on Quora.

Seriously speaking the decision was never easy, it was confusing like anything and may still have serious consequences. 

My most important aim post college was that I wanted to learn, and what exactly did I want to learn ? I wanted to learn the web stack, whole of it, from one end to the other. I had interned in HackerRank in December (unofficially), for just 2 weeks, and in those 2 weeks itself, I got to hack on their core application, and their core tools, I was even allowed to push code to production (well kind of, I did push, but it had some bug, and was rolled back). In short I learned a lot, A LOT, fell in love with MVC, learned a lot of new tools, and in short had fun in a hacker way. I was sure if I could get this much exposure in such a short time, I could in a few years master what I wanted to. 

My family supported me in this decision, (obv after asking a few questions), and my mom told me that "If you want to risk, better do it now, in any case you don't lose what you learn". My facebook friends can see my dad's support on the status related to this. In short, they gave me a sort of courage, which meant, I could finally take the decision on my own. 

I wanted to build things, and I felt HackerRank would give me the opportunity to do all that.Essentially I had used HackerRank/Interviewstree<wbr />t and had liked it, except for their occasional "hanging" when a large number of users submitted the problem, **"HR was a product I liked using".**Also Interviewstreet was the best among the tools the companies that came for hiring at IIT Kanpur used.** **I had participated in their Codesprint and got a couple of invites too from other companies, and had (and still do) hate the "Apply with your resume" thing on tech company career page. All you got was a default reject letter. 

I felt that I would be more comfortable in a startup environment than microsoft (maybe because of what [Joel Elias](http://quora.com/Joel-Elias-1) told I may be a bit nutty), and HackerRank/Interviewstreet was an ideal fit, since they did what I liked, they weren't too large that I would miss out on a lot of things, neither were they too early, that they were unstable. They had among their investors two people I admired, [Vinod Khosla](http://quora.com/Vinod-Khosla-1) and [Paul Graham](http://quora.com/Paul-Graham) (actually YC), and also because of the nature of the work they were in, the company interacted with a lot of awesome people in the tech world. 

Now finally coming to the company as such, as I said the people were awesome, actually dunno what I should write here. So let us just leave at AWESOME. 

And finally a slightly over-confident point, I did a worst case analysis, and I felt. 

1.  If 1 year after joining HackerRank, I didn't like it, I felt I would still be able to get into other companies on level with Microsoft (except for Microsoft)
2.  If 1 year after Microsoft, I felt I would still be able to join startups, but felt the opportunity now was unique, I felt even if I was able to join HackerRank a year later, it just wouldn't be the same.

P.S : I also watched the first ever cricket match in a stadium thanks to HackerRank, but unfortunately India lost in that match, so I am not sure if I should include that point. 

Epilogue : 
I am now forever banned from applying to Microsoft, since I took this decision a bit late, by then I had already moved forward and accepted the Microsoft offer, which meant I went back on their offer.
