*Warning : A post from a person  who doesn't know much of what he is speaking*

It has been 10 years. 10 years since "The 9/11". Ten years since terrorism was given a whole new meaning. Ten years since the USA as we know it changed. Looking back at what happened on September 11<sup>th</sup> 2001, and more importantly on what happened "Post 9/11". I am forced to ask 

>Did Osama Bin Laden win the War ?

Did Osama actually finally win the battle he fought with USA ? For all it may seem that he hasn't, Osama bin Laden is most probably now dead, and Taliban now just rules over small regions of Afghanistan compared to almost the entire country it had in the beginning, Al-Qeada is also battling for it's survival. All this is true ,  but this was not a war between two nations, or between two groups or between two people. *This was a war between one huge nation and a small group*. For any normal situation the fact that "USA Survied, Team Bin Laden did not" would suffice, but not here.

The USA now is not the USA that was there in the past, USA has changed. Al-Qeada or Bin Laden could not have destroyed USA, even if they had tried all their attacks, and had send 1000 planes all over the nation, that is just not how nations are destroyed, the largest reason for the destruction of a nation, in the past, present and in the future will be the following 3 reasons

- Civil Unrest
- Collapse of the Government
- Collapse of the Economy.

This is how large and well to do nations are bought down  on the knees, this is the way to destroy them (Take USSR if you are that unsure), and this is why I believe Osama Bin Laden may have just had a victory, may not be complete one, but yet a victory.

Let us look at what happens after 9/11.

- Operation Enduring Freedom is declared.
- Iraq Invasion
- Global Economic Meltdown
- The US Debt Crisis

Well yes in order these are the four thing of largest significance that happened in the US. The current issue "The US Debt Crisis" and partly the previous issue of "Global (US in particular) Economic Meltdown" have been mainly the making of the US itself, but it does have it's significant roots in the above two issues. The total expenses due to the wars alone have been roughly $1.2 Trillion US Dollars, but this excludes the larger focus put on other military spendings and research. For e.g: here is the graph from wikipedia.

</figure>


And as you can see that Military spending was actually on a decline, USA was spending less and less on military expenses until 2002, until the moment it started the whole "War against Terrorism", and they have spent nearly $10 Trillion on defence since, of which about 2.5 Trillion to 3 Trillion could have been saved, and even more alarming is the fact that they still are projected to rise , the spendings are still projected to increase when USA needs cash the most.

In short Osama in some ways achieved one of the thee points needed to bring down a nation, Osama made the nation of USA not just to go to war, *but to get stuck in it*, and it is not over yet, for atleast a few more years it will still be there, spend their money on it, and yet finally have created nothing but unrest in the nations, with the terrorist groups very much active even if not as strong. Osama may well have laid the trap, and USA partly due to it's pride and partly due to it's greed got stuck in it. This is not to say that America should not have looked for payback, but saying that it  didn't do it all that great, and the war on terror cost USA valuable trillions of dollars, which well they could have used right about now.  The rest two of them are not in a good state etierh, even though USA is nowhere near a civil unrest, the people are displeased with the governement, and the government itself is in a complicated mess. In short Osama did about 30% of what was need to bring USA down. 
And this is why I believe as much as I hate what I say, "Osama might have won"

Osama's attacks seem symbolic when viewed,

- He attacked the World Trade Centre which was the iconic American symbol for all that was good about it's Capitalistic Markets and Economy
- He attacked the Pentagon, the American symbol for all that was leading of it's Defense (or should we say Offense) department
- He may have planned to attack the Capitol, or the White House which is therir symbol of their Democracy and the government.

Another point being what was pointed in "The Hindu" today Americans even after 10 years are still in shock, of the day America (if not the World) stood still and witness the wrath of the fury of a small group.

And what did he loose in return, Al-Qeada is still a terrorist outfit and is still active, well all he seems to have lost recently is his life (and as Paul Kuliniewicz would say "After all, it could only cost you your life, and you got that for free"), and yeah Taliban but too small a price to pay for bringing USA down.

Yes people, and that is why I believe sadly Osama may have just won this one in the long run.
