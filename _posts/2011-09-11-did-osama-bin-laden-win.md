*Warning : A post from a person  who doesn't know much of what he is speaking*

It has been 10 years. 10 years since "The 9/11". Ten years since
terrorism was given a whole new meaning. Ten years since the USA as
we know it changed. Looking back at what happened on September 11th
2001, and more importantly on what happened "Post 9/11". I am
forced to ask bq. h2. Did Osama Bin Laden win the War ?

Did Osama actually finally win the battle he fought with USA ? For
all it may seem that he hasn't, Osama bin Laden is most probably
now dead, and Taliban now just rules over small regions of
Afghanistan compared to almost the entire country it had in the
beginning, Al-Qeada is also battling for it's survival. All this is
true ,  but this was not a war between two nations, or between two
groups or between two people.
*This was a war between one huge nation and a small group*. For any
normal situation the fact that "USA Survied, Team Bin Laden did
not" would suffice, but not here.

The USA now is not the USA that was there in the past, USA has
changed. Al-Qeada or Bin Laden could not have destroyed USA, even
if they had tried all their attacks, and had send 1000 planes all
over the nation, that is just not how nations are destroyed, the
largest reason for the destruction of a nation, in the past,
present and in the future will be the following 3 reasons
<ol>
    <li>
Civil Unrest
</li>
    <li>
Collapse of the Government
</li>
    <li>
Collapse of the Economy.
</li>
</ol>
This is how large and well to do nations are bought down  on the
knees, this is the way to destroy them (Take USSR if you are that
unsure), and this is why I believe Osama Bin Laden may have just
had a victory, may not be complete one, but yet a victory.

Let us look at what happens after 9/11.
<ol>
    <li>
Operation Enduring Freedom is declared.
</li>
    <li>
Iraq Invasion
</li>
    <li>
Global Economic Meltdown
</li>
    <li>
The US Debt Crisis
</li>
</ol>
Well yes in order these are the four thing of largest significance
that happened in the US. The current issue "The US Debt Crisis" and
partly the previous issue of "Global (US in particular) Economic
Meltdown" have been mainly the making of the US itself, but it does
have it's significant roots in the above two issues. The total
expenses due to the wars alone have been roughly $1.2 Trillion US
Dollars, but this excludes the larger focus put on other military
spendings and research. For e.g: here is the graph from wikipedia.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="800" caption="The
Inflation adjusted (for 2009) Military Spending for
USA"]<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/InflationAdjustedDefenseSpending.PNG/800px-InflationAdjustedDefenseSpending.PNG"><img title="US Military Budget" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/InflationAdjustedDefenseSpending.PNG/800px-InflationAdjustedDefenseSpending.PNG" alt="US Military Budget Graph" width="800" height="384" /></a>[/caption]

And as you can see that Military spending was actually on a
decline, USA was spending less and less on military expenses until
2002, until the moment it started the whole "War against
Terrorism", and they have spent nearly $10 Trillion on defence
since, of which about 2.5 Trillion to 3 Trillion could have been
saved, and even more alarming is the fact that they still are
projected to rise , the spendings are still projected to increase
when USA needs cash the most.

In short Osama in some ways achieved one of the thee points needed
to bring down a nation, Osama made the nation of USA not just to go
to war, \_but to get stuck in it,  \_and it is not over yet, for
atleast a few more years it will still be there, spend their money
on it, and yet finally have created nothing but unrest in the
nations, with the terrorist groups very much active even if not as
strong. Osama may well have laid the trap, and USA partly due to
it's pride and partly due to it's greed got stuck in it. This is
not to say that America should not have looked for payback, but
saying that it didn't do it all that great.

and the war on terror cost USA valuable trillions of dollars, which
well they could have used right about now.  The rest two of them
are not in a good state etierh, even though USA is nowhere near a
civil unrest, the people are displeased with the governement, and
the government itself is in a complicated mess. In short Osama did
about 30% of what was need to bring USA down. And this is why I
believe as much as I hate what I say, "Osama might have won"

Osama's attacks seem symbolic when viewed,
<ul>
    <li>
he attacked the World Trade Centre which was the iconic American
symbol for all that was good about it's Capitalistic Markets and
Economy
</li>
    <li>
he attacked the Pentagon, the American symbol for all that was
leading of it's Defense (or should we say Offense) department,
</li>
    <li>
and he may have planned to attack the Capitol, or the White House
which is therir symbol of their Democracy and the government.
</li>
</ul>
Another point being what was pointed in "The Hindu" today Americans
even after 10 years are still in shock, of the day America (if not
the World) stood still and witness the wrath of the fury of a small
group.

And what did he loose in return, Al-Qeada is still a terrorist
outfit and is still active, well all he seems to have lost recently
is his life (and as Paul Kuliniewicz would say "After all, it could
only cost you your life, and you got that for free"), and yeah
Taliban but too small a price to pay for bringing USA down.

Yes people and that is why I believe sadly Osama may have just won
this one in the long run.
