I had a lot betting on Germany vs Argentina, no not money, but pride, each and every inch of what I had, and well just like that Germany defeated Argentina, and I was saved, but a vast majority who was with Argentina are now licking their wounds, So I thought that why not create another FB Wall here, lots of statuses to post, YES, I have been preparing for this moment, just didn't wanna jinx it so starting the blog only now.

*Please Note : Any hurt inflicted upon the Argentinians is intended, and I shall ask for no pardon.*

**Finger 1** : Germany has a war technique of Blitzkrieg which involves the rapid advance of their forward line, without any regard to the opposition flank and only stopping when they reach their target. The only way to stop a Blitzkreig is to have a
brilliant defence, or a brilliant counter.  Just saw that in action, and only one country has ever seen that in actual action (I mean during World War) still lasts, Spain. Go on Germany you can take even them.

**F \#2** : Paul the Octopus was so good at predicting the results coz, the Germans behave like an octopus, with 11 limbs, and one central control. That makes them a team. For Maradonna who believes that one person can create history, yes but in football that person has to be one with 11 bodies.



**F \#3**:

The site where Argentinian Car badly crashed into the Berlin Wall,the following people sadly met their demise Mardonna the Legendo(50's), Messi the Hypo (20's), Argentinian the prido (100's). All of them met with instant death and have been identified, the van also included 10 other people. Their bodies will be taken back to Argentina, the next day. The reason for the crash has been identified as over speeding without any regard for safety or control.



**F \#4** : Messi is a perfect player, so perfect  that he resembles the most perfect of all figures, the Circle or the ZERO, which in fact is also his goal count.

**F \#5**: USA president Obama orders, a preemptive attack on Germany, on the recent evidence of Germany having weapons of Messi Destruction, and the return of Blitzkreig.

**F \#6**: Brazil and Argentina to organise their own finals in South America, citing the reason that that was the final most of the fans rooted for. They are waiting for Paraguay, to see if all of them can go together and get a discount on the airline fee.

**F \#7** : A Serious One Now : For all those who still think Argentina is much better, and more predictable, Germans have been the winners, the finalists, semi-finalists and quarter finalists far more times than the Argentinian team.

**F \#8:** Thanks to Javaiz for the seed of the idea : Germans are engineers, they just beautifully took apart a malfunctioning Argentinian machine, and put together a brilliant goal scoring machine from that.



**F \#9**: Germany really hates homosexuals, for they denied Maradonna the chance to run naked, and also put down his "kiss-and-hug-argentinian-players" management technique

**F \#10** :

The match I waited for has happened and couldn't have ended better, Now I don't care even if the Germans don't take the Cup, my wish has been fulfilled, and would still love them to take the cup, and am supporting them for it. Really afraid of the Spaniards though. 

All of you are free to add to these 10 fingers for Argentina. In fact, if any Argentinian fan is still out there, I dare you to comment, except the following comment I warned the Brazilians not to do "We barely missed out this time, watch for us at next world cup" . Coz like Brazilian fans you already did that once and we
know how it ended.

For the Argentinian Fans : To be honest, I was really afraid for 10 minutes before and after half time, whether you would score a goal. It was a pleasure watching the match.
