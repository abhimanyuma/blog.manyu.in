Section 66 A of the Information Technologies Act says as follows

> 66A. Punishment for sending offensive messages through communication service, etc..-
> Any person who sends, by means of a computer resource or a communication device,-
> 
> (a) any information that is grossly offensive or has menacing character; *or*
>
> (b) any information which he knows to be false, but for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, or ill will, persistently makes by making use of such computer resource or a communication device,
>
> (c) any electronic mail or electronic mail message for the purpose of causing annoyance or inconvenience or to deceive or to mislead the addressee or recipient about the origin of such messages
>
> shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and with fine. 

The greatest problem I find with the above law - Any information that if offensive or has a menacing character; *even if it is true,Â *is punishable. How much a message is offensive is often decided not by the sender but by the recipient, which means most often than not, calling a spade a spade is *a crime.*

So it doesn't matter if Karti Chidambaram has more wealth than Robert Vadra, It doesn't matter if Bhagat Singh is better than Bal Thackeray but stating it is a problem. The fact the country and the people in power need to realize is that *"Truth is truth, whether you agree to it, or find it offending"*.

The laws with regard to Blasphemy in the state are also no different.

Take the [case of Sanal Edamuruku](http://www.sacw.net/article2634.html), he was booked under the blasphemy law for two things -

- Proving in front of the media that the "Miracle Water" that came from the foot of a statue of Jesus in Mumbai, was in fact drainage water that swept up because of capillary action.
- For stating that there exists exorcism in Christianity. *(The fact that exorcism is in fact a [Sacremental](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramentals) in Christianity, sadly lay forgotten.)*


The implications are startling -
- It is better to have pleasing lies than to have offensive truths,*since there is no law against pleasing lies*. It doesn't end there. To know where it will get us take the following case.

There is two people "John Doe" and "Jane Doe", both of whom are pretending to be extremely poor. (*I used the standard US Anonymous names since other names may put me under the same law*).

I tweet 

> John Doe has amassed more wealth than Jane Doe 

My friend tweets

> Jane Doe has amassed more wealth than John Doe.

The fact is it doesn't matter who is right, but both will be arrested since it offends the people who are pretending to be poor.

To rephrase *It is better to have pleasing lies than to have offensive truths, but the best action is to keep quiet.* The advantages of such a population for the ruling elite is ENORMOUS. It is their dream to have a population that doesn't question them, or point out their flaws. May be that is why our dear Prime Minister is always quiet on most of the issues, or may be not.

(*Readers may please note that the author makes no assumption, just considers a possibility, lest I should get arrested)*.

It is often quoted that *There is nothing more important to a democracy than an informed electorate, and yet here is a law that attempts to quieten us.*

Everyone has to wake up someday to the fact that the truth may well offend you, then your course of action should be to correct yourselves not to put the other person behind bars.

Note : I am not saying Jr. Chidambaram has more wealth, but just saying that the fact that the complaint will remain even if he has the wealth is deeply disturbing.
