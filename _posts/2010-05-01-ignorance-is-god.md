Every second a large number of blogs appear in WordPress, with “God” being tagged in it, in this age when all the religions unite to say that man is drifting away from God, this number is quite a surprise and the cyberspace sure hasn’t forgotten God. This blog is just putting into words what I feel about God.

I feel that from olden times till the present age, God has been just an excuse for man’s ignorance. Anything that the human race, thought about, but couldn’t explain was devoted to being Godly, or divine. Man and his ego, never could accept that those things were worldly and natural and yet he couldn’t explain them. In the olden times when man was unable to explain how fire, or rain, or wind, was created all of them happened to be God, he worshipped them. Man was still in his infancy then, he observed only what was visible to him on the surface. Look how when science started coming up with logical explanation for each of these phenomenon, their Godliness decreased, they became less Godly and more worldly.

Human race has advanced much from that point, but yet God is still portrayed as a very sad excuse. Birth, Life and Death are three very important things that *science* can talk a million words about, but yet unable to describe the essence of it, and hence birth, life and death came to be associated with God. Miracles, if we look at it are  nothing but incidents that our knowledge of *science* just couldn’t explain, and as expected they are also associated with God. If we are to take in all this, God will be just a *“Conjurer of few cheap tricks”.*

All religions unite to say that man has been moving away from the Gods, well now that science is explaining more and more things, the world a man observes becomes less of God, and more of logic and *science*, and hence his moving away from the religions, for when the religions were established most of the things we see now were a wonder, and was godly in nature.

*Karma* one of the other things associated with God, is something I don’t believe in its normal sense. I believe karma is an internal manifestation of the sub conscious mind, so as long as we do something that we believe in, we need not fear *karma.* Karma comes only when we understand that something is wrong, our sub conscious mind corrects us somehow, and I do believe that random things can happen because chaos is inherent with the universe.

You might have noticed by now that I have italicised all the appearances of science  till now. The reason being that I believe Science (without the italics) is God. Now for those who claim that Science is imperfect, I say that it is never imperfect, it is only the human understanding of Science which we call *science* that is imperfect. Science has an explanation to each and everything that is happening; it is just that we don’t know what it is yet.
