It was round about the year 2000 that Vision India 2020 became a catch phrase, everyone everywhere from Politicians, News Anchors to the Local Chaiwalas were talking about how India would evolve itself to be a super power above any other nation (esp. those US B\*\*tards),and how each and everyone would live in total peace and comfort.

11 years down the lane, India is pretty much the same it was, the same politics, the same religious following of cricket, the same BPO's, the same corruption and so on and on. The only vision about 2020 is that of Lalit Modi and his cash racking IPL, that sure is new.

All this but could be for nothing if the world was to end on 20<sup>th</sup> December 2012, all the progress, all the bloody assignments thousands of students did could end up to total waste, but I believe this could be India's turning point.

How the world will endÂ  : Pak fires a nuke (brought from US) at India, but given their technical expertise, it veers off course to the original target US had programmed, Russia. Russia sees the attack and responds with its missiles to US and Pak. In the resulting nuclear war all of the world's nations are destroyed.

This is where the story ends for each and every one of us,but this is where India's next generation takes birth, it's Cockroaches, with their skills for surviving a nuclear fall out, they will turn out to be the true inheritor's of this world. Now in a world full of nuclear radiation, mutation will occur at break neck speeds and these cockroaches will evolve to be Homo Sapiens v1.0 (We I believe are/were just a beta version).

Now this is where India will start to dominate, we have the best cockroaches possible
- They can occupy the most inhabitable of locations (In between the clothes I wore for a week and never washed)
- They just hunt out every minuscule of food.
- Their true India nature, they just multiply like crazy, there is one cockroach in the house today, there are 100's in a month.
- We have absolutely no pest control or anything even close.

So with such a force world domination would be piece of cake, so by the time the cockroaches become human there would only be India and nothing else, so we immediately qualify for the most developed, most prosperous, the super power and so on.
