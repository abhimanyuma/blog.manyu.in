As a programming newbie, I love hackathons. I have often learned more at them, than at other places. This time however I was unable to attend Microsoft's code.fun.do at IIT Kanpur because of my thesis commitments. However the hack that won the first place surprised me. 

Usually what happens in Hackathons is the following 

1. Identify a problem that exists or something that would be interesting to build
2. Look at a solution close to what you need and extend it. 
3. Present it. 

Usually most of the products make use of some unique point about something, and extend it. This time however the team that won the first prize did something unique. They took a product and used it's weak point to build their hack. 

So the hack was done by [Shubdeep Kocchar](https://www.facebook.com/shubhdeepk) and his friends, they built an app that aimed to improve your pronounciation. The way they did is that that they built upon the fact that the "Speech to Text" in Windows sucks, and will accept your word ONLY IF spoken exactly as they have it in their phonetic dictionary, even slight variations do NOT work. I do not know who in their team came up with the idea, but it was one hell of an idea, and with a really good interface they developed, it turned out to be awesome. 

So they used the fact that the "Speech to Text" option in Windows was bad, and built up a hack on top of that. This is for me the first time, I am seeing someone use the disadvantage of a product and making an app out of it. 

For this they were awarded the first prize (Nokia Lumia 520) by Microsoft. I dunno about the others, but for me, it was bit of ironically humorous.
