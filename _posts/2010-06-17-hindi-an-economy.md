The constitution of India[^indian-constitution] is where the entire linguistic issues in India start from, it specified Hindi along with English as the official language, with English planned to be phased out in 15 years.

This set a deadline of January 26,1965 for the Government of India to decide on the official and national languages to be in use. In fact it was decided to phase out English and to have Hindi as the sole official language. In fact many of the north Indian states even pushed for "Hindi as the National Language". The south Indian states at the same time saw this as a possible threat to their languages, central govt. job opportunities,and state proceedings and thus sparked of a huge protest[^time-article] which led to riots in Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry (Puducherry); and violence in Kerala, Karnataka and other south Indian states, with Bengal also joining in. Finally this move was dropped and "The Official Languages Act 1963 (further amended in 1967)" was passed, and an Official Languages committee was also formed.

Hindi continued as the official language with English, supplementing it. In fact all rulings, judgements, law proceedings, etc. at the Central Government level has to have an authoritative translation in English as well. State governments were free to decide their official language, and inter state communication has to be in English (or Hindi, if both of the states accept Hindi, as their official language). So the "Hindi as the national language" move was dropped and as a result, India has no national language even now.

A search in Google for India's national language will return you hundreds of articles which either support one claim or the other. In general, what is seen is a debate between

1. The need for uniting India under a single language and to make administration easier.

2. The freedom of a state and it's people to choose their language, given the fact that states were formed on linguistic basis.

Since these topics have been debated 100's of times and often with no particular result , I am NOT going to write about any of those, but instead I will focus on two things English and Economy.

Imagine a situation where Hindi was made the national language of India, then Hindi would happen to be the first language for education in all the states, and since the linguistic fervor was still high, it would be followed by the regional language of the
state. English would be pushed to the position of a third language and might even be made optional. 

The educational structure would be

* First language – Hindi
* Second language – Regional Language/ English for Hindi speaking states
* Third Language – English/Nothing for Hindi speaking states.

Hindi would now be the common language of India whether it be in the north or the south. English which ser ved the job of being the mediator language, would now have no purpose, all nation wide publications, media, and inter-state interaction would be in Hindi. In fact it would have helped the industries as only one language was required through out. We have to remember that this was a time when television meant your local doordarshan, and Internet was not even dreamed about, English would become as foreign to Indians as any other language. As would be the case with anything that loses it's significance, English literacy would have absolutely no use, and could thus drop. Slowly without enough reasons to survive, English would have lost out to Hindi and other regional languages.

Now let us look at economy, from the 1950's to 1980's India followed a economic policy known as- Licence Raj[^wikipedia-license-raj] whereby capitalistic growth was met with red tapes, and all industrial activity was govt. owned or govt. restricted, and all industries required to obtain permission(Licence) from numerous governmental offices. In this bureaucratic setup, rampant with corruption, private industry would have meant a near impossible thing to start, and foreign investments and multinationals would be even unheard of. The phase from 1950 to 1991 is considered as one of the worst phases for the Indian Economy, referred to as "Nehruvian Socialist rate of growth",[^wikipedia-indian-economy-history] India's growth rate fell to 3.5% and its per-capita income growth rate was as low as 1%. India which started out a high industrial growth rate and economic stability would in 1991 see low growth rates and economic crisis.

At this point history tells us that for the bailout from IMF we were forced to free up our markets, and the policy of Liberalization[^wikipedia-indian-economy-liberalisation] was set in motion under Rajiv Gandhi, Narasimha Rao, (as Prime Ministers) and Manmohan Singh (as Finance Minster).Doing away with its Licence Raj policy Indian economy started to pick up. Foreign investment and multinationals started to come to India recognising its huge potential market, and India was able to interact with the global market. In fact later our share in the world market grew, but consider situation of a Hindian nation, the change would have been much slower, foreign economies would have come to India, but it would have taken time before India started giving back.

Rajiv Gandhi promoted the IT and the telecommunication industries in the 90s and Narasimha Rao followed, multinationals and foreign investment came, and more than it investment within India was also significantly freed up, now Indians could start more and more industries and companies, without the huge hassles of Licence Raj , and with global interaction we started to have Indian contribution not just for India, but for the global economy as well. It was this give and take that helped us reach at a point of sustainable yet a significantly high growth rate of 8%. At present Indian Economy with it's magnitude and growth rate, is seen as significant factor in shaping the Global Economy. In fact Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs, predicted in 2001 that Brazil, Russia, India and China will together emerge as the largest economies in the world, by 2050[^wikipedia-indian-economy-development].

Now we go back and examine what would have happened had Hindi been the national languages, and with English sidelined. Many foreign companies would have come to India even if it was a Hindian nation, but in the absence of a sound knowledge of English, India would have been just been a trade hub, not something where development
would take place. Indian companies would not have been able to export as much. India would not have become a development centre for the other nations. We would NOT have been recognised as a nation with huge, economic and quality human resource.We would not have been able to interact much with the world outside. IT companies, telecommunication companies, and other companies would not have decided to come to India. We would not have had Indian companies in these fields make their global footprint. Even now there are many countries which offer much cheaper labour than India, but the reason India became a outsourcing hub was because India managed to strike a very good balance between cost and quality. In fact this is very similar to what globalisation is currently doing in Africa. Given the current lack of exposure for technology in India, the lack of English knowledge would have only made it worse.

Unlike other nations, service industry[^wikipedia-indian-economy] was the one that developed the most, India greatest export was not it's products, but it's people and their service. In this context, the importance of English is more and that is why we cannot look at highly industrial countries like Germany and Japan, when saying that even an Hindian economy would have just as well improved. Even for a sound contribution to Industrial economy, English is now a necessity. In fact without that the companies that came to India might have been under complete foreign control.

You could possibly say that India could have given focus to English when this started to happen, and so have both a national language and a strong economy, but then by the time India had their human resource base strong,time would have passed, India entered the world economy almost at the time,when socialistic ideas fell, and markets were opening up, had we missed this window, things would have been different. (No, it is not a coincidence. The fall of socialism was what indeed prompted India, to open up their markets). In short Hindian economy would have missed out on the time, and having the GDP of 2000 in 2010 would not make India a possible economic superpower, and hence my argument that a Hindian economy would have been a hindering economy.

If I have hurt any regional sentiments, I apologise.

This is my first attempt on a non-tech serious article, so pardon any of the non-sense I may have said.

P.S : Gujarat High Court has a verdict[^court-verdict] on Hindi NOT being the national language.
