Present day India is a strange mix of everything, and by everything, I do mean everything, every religion, every language, every nationality (and for the nationalities we don't have we do have call centre employees pretending to be foreign).

India is a land of extremes, so extreme that the place Jehangir (or some other Mughal Emperor, History has never been interesting) described as "Paradise on Earth" is now a beautiful war ground rich with beauty, terrorism and soldiers. India is the land of the Ambanis, Nobel Laurates, and world leaders and the nobodies, illiterates and the slum lords. It should then be no wonder that India is part of the BRIC (supposedly the world's next super powers for those who haven't heard of it) and is one of the "Most Corrupt Developing Nation". Our principles of “Spreading the Wealth” has had so much influence that we have Illegal (Black Money) Swiss Bank deposits that equal our GDP, an amount of $ 1.5 trillion (75 Lakh Crore Rupees)  . We are a nation which gives the best of our products and services to the foreign markets and keeps the second best for ourselves, I believe it is because we truly believe in “(Hindi) Atithi Devo Bhava”

## Travelling

### Roads


Anywhere else travelling is just a mundane task of getting you from Point A to Point B, you might catch a bit of scenery but as before India is not "any" place, and hence travelling is filled with mystery, excitement and many more flavours.

Consider a simple car trip from Calicut to Mukkam, in any other nation a mere GPS would suffice, in India it never does.

* 1000's of pedestrians/auto wallahs at every point to tell you which  roads will get your car to Mukkam and thankfully they do not tell you the correct road for they believe "You cannot ask for a direction, you have to earn it"

* The newspaper of every party to inform you of any Hartals/Bandhs/Processions or Road Blockades.

* If it is the end of the month a couple of hundreds to give to the Police officers who invariably finds some fault with your car.

* A bit more cash to give to all the "Bucket Fund Collections" on the way.

Finally if you have managed to get all these, don't worry about being there on time for you will find yourselves stuck in traffic, or in between a procession or the worst of all, in a pothole.  But believe me, by this time you would have learned


* Mukkam can be pronounced as "MMukkam" "Mukkkaaam" "Mukam" "Mukham" (and please don't get me started on Yen-Ayi-Tee(NIT))

* Manmohan Singh is a CIA spy deployed in India to uproot Communist Anti-Fascist forces. 

* Section 69-A requires you to have some sort of flashy sticker on your rear wind shield.

* There are 125 roads that will NOT take you to Mukkam, but you would have travelled on most of them.

### Trains

If you think the roads have taught you everything, it comes nothing to what the trains teach you. Here the literary idioms come to life.

If you think your train is a sh!thole, then welcome to Indian Railways, here you have actual sh!tholes, where you can manure the rails with your own sh!t (provided the toilet isn't already overcrowded with normal passengers, and you can aim). It has become so popular that, people now do it even without having a train around them.

* When they say “X brings people together”, “Y bridges the gap between the poor and the rich” they are speaking figuratively, but when I tell you that in the trains differences between the rich, the poor, the upper caste and the lower vaporise and that everyone merges in the general compartment to form one large blob of Indians, I am being literal.

* You haven’t experienced “thinking outside the box” until and unless you hang on the footboard from the overcrowded compartment, and think about ways of scratching you itchy nose.


## Politics

In India politics is family gossip and *The Family* is a political obsession. In olden times we had royal families ruling us, but after long battles, *satyagrahas*, sufferings, and sacrifices, India has become a country with a government by the people, of the people and for the people, and hence we have an *Aaam* Family ruling us *democratically.* India is the only nation where political parties, transcend even their ideologies, for the greater good of the “*Aaam Aadmi*”, and his personal bank accounts in Switzerland.

Every now and then all the political parties in India come together for a giant party called Elections, where everybody runs around, forms teams, plays games (the favourite being ping pong, where the balls of the common man is bounced between the various parties) and finally cuts the National cake and distributes it in manner so that everyone has at least a small slice of the Indian cake.

If someone was to elaborate on Indian politics the books would fill even the largest of libraries and yet would not make sense. In fact you could describe Indian politics as an infinite stream of non-senselessness, and the Indian media has this as their driving force.

## Religion

Religion in India is something God will be truly pleased, for it has grown beyond mere spirituality and has resulted in three things

- Communal Clashes
- Politics
- Reservation

Reservation is generally handled by the lottery department and every year they draw up a random permutation of alphabets and find a community to fit that, SC,ST,OBC,OEC, etc., have already been allotted and the following BC,XBC,XT,XXX, WMD and LOL are due for implementation. Religion in India is rumoured to be the long lost brother of politics, and every now and then they unite for the above mentioned grand party called Elections. We have the best of politicians for they understand the scriptures better than the priests and preach them as if they were sent, by God himself. Also at random points our religious leaders turn political, and political leaders go religious. What else can we ask for when we get such flexibility and friendship between India’s two largest passions.

If I continue on the same topic, chances are I would most likely not be around by the time you see this post , and considering no one reads my blog, you sure can figure out how powerful it is and hence would like to stop here, but remember if politics would fill libraries, religion would fill mountains.

## Sports

Someone once said 
> “Exercise is best done part of a person's lifestyle” 
and hence we have set up the most ingenious ways to exercise our body, which includes

- Running after the Buses.
- Hanging on to footboards
- Getting chased by dogs.
- Mere process of walking down a street involves an intricate series of jumping, running and swimming


All this and more have made Indians highly fit, but sadly our potholes have deprived us of our ability to run straight and hence we haven't been able to receive medals in Olympics or any other sport, but the latest news is that India has their future in Hurdles.  For persons who are normally fit, sports serve no purpose and hence, the only sports we dominate in are where fitness is not aimed at, Cricket and Chess.

The Commonwealth games which concluded recently highlighted the progress India has made in the various fields (low cost construction with high wealth allocation to name one) and has put India just behind China in terms of sports. Shhhh.... about Asian games or the Olympics, for we can choose which to believe in. What saddened me most about Commonwealth was that we could have even taken the top spot had we done something as simple as Reservation, all had to do was to reserve 49% of the medals for the Indians, on account of belonging to ABC (Athletically Backward Country).

We are a nation with Hockey as our national sport, and cricket as the entire nation's passion, a fitting tribute to our Elected Minister and the Super Minister behind him. It is this passion that makes them worship each player like Gods one moment and burn their effigies the next, and since India wins brilliantly and losses even more spectacularly in the next game, each and every player has got his shares of glory and shame, except may be Sachin, for he isn't like God to Indians but God is like Sachin. If Bollywood is ruled by the K's, the S’s are the leaders in sports Sachin, Sehwag,
Saina, Sania ....

## Education

We are supposedly the youngest nation in the world, and are ruled by the oldest people. Our parents are so free and modern that they want their kids to have their own ambition,BUT as long as it is

1. I want to get a BTech+MBA

2. I want to get a MBBS +MD + DM +...

and the most preferred of them all (sadly the once who says this
never realises that his fate is now sealed)

-   I want to get an IAS

The moment you complete your educations, as was said above, the best batch in India is send abroad so that they can serve not just the entire nation, but the world, and we humbly keep the second best for us, since some old guy said “Vasudeva Kudumbagam- The whole word is one family” (and no one was smart enough to understand  that what he meant was to have a relationship with each and every female outside his family)

The situation is so severe in the education sector that all courses other than Engineering, Medicine and Managment could approach the government for “Minority Reservation”, whereby each of the courses will be assured at least a minimum number of students. The feudal system that was supposedly long abolished from the Nation still exists in the given form in Engineering/Management.

At the top level is IIT/IIMs and then NIT/XLRI and so on followed by State collleges and finally Pvt. Colleges the pay and the precentage of population at each level reflect a feudal setup. 

## Marriages & Relationships

Marriages in India, as one of my friend ( Manjo Jojo S8) once told, is not made either in Heaven or in Hell, but over the dinner table. Marriages don’t just bring two souls together, but it builds capital, befriends enemies, merges companies and wins elections. Chetan Bhagat states, getting married the *cupid* (often confused
for stupid) *way* is harder than even getting into IIMs. This helps lower our divorce rates, for Indian couple come into the marriages expect their spouses to be *(wo)man eating werewolves trapped in a human's body*. This works out very well since

- If they are actually *(wo)man eating werewolves*, then they won't be around to make a  divorce.
- If they are not, the family will live happily ever after, since their spouse Exceeds Expectations.

Going by the current scenario even the cupid has been bribed so that he considers the person’s religion, salary, region and horoscope before he shoots his precious arrows. The modern youth has now understood that variety is the spice of life, and hence strives to maintain as many *relations* as possible. The modern India is so specialised that we now have a boyfriend/girlfriend for

1. Going out
2. To keep a “awwww” photo on the table
3. To show to their parents
4. To go with, to parties
5. For eternal bliss.

## Bollywood

The closest the normal Indian gets to a love marriage is when they remember their *long lost love* during a Bollywood movie, with their *arranged* spouse sitting right next to them. This is just one example of how Bollywood has uplifted the human emotions (and it is just one among other things they have uplifted).

It is said that Bollywood was highly elated when Section 377 was legalised for they can now have truly triangular love stories, where Kareena loves SRK, who loves John Abraham, who loves Kareena who loves ... , this cyclic loop gives them the opportunity to drag the story on and on, and the possibilities are endless (Imagine
Kareena catching SRK on cheating her for John).

Bollywood movies are yet again a random permutation of family feud, problematic love stories, item number, politics and the underworld. As anyone would see the scope is very little yet have had thousands of film, may be due to our ability to do more with less.  It is a land of the opposites where the rich and famous have scarcity for clothes and the poor have layers and layers of clothing.

## Corruption
Space where author has been paid to write about corruption Will be completed next month 


And thus ends the story of Incredible India, but the author would
like to add

**Love it, hate it but whatever you do, you are an Indian, and it’s cool to be one.**

NB : This is a slightly modified version of an article by the title "It Happens only in Indiaaaa...." in the college magazine.

NB2: The whole of the article is meant as a dry sarcastic joke, and not to be taken seriously. The author means no disrespect for his great nation, but just believes that "*laughing at yourselves is one of the best way of introspection"*
