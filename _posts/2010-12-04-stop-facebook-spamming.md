<p style="text-align:justify;">
Well for the past 2 weeks Facebook has been filled with spamming
messages left right and centre, and since it occured alphabetically
and since I am Abhimanyu, I was one of the worst hit not as much as
Aakhi, or Aakarsh but still well enough to piss me off. So here is
what I think would solve your problem. Please do this if your
status message is getting updated unknowingly, and posting on other
people's wall.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The solution is in two parts, the first being the precautionary
things you need to do before the actual solution (hopefully it
works).

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Right now the solution does not depend on the precautionary
messages but you might want to use them for better protection, and
spamming attacks in future.

Step 5: Stop being dumb enough to click on random links on your
profiles especially from the .tk TLD, and even if you do that
*DO NOT PASTE AND RUN JAVASCRIPTS FROM RANDOM SOURCES THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.*

*Please note you can do this only a limited number of times and hence as "Click Wisely, Live Well"*

*The solution ends here rest is on how it happens.*
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">*My take on how it Spams*</span>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Facebook gives you a secret upload mail id to upload to your
profile from mobiles, where you might not be able to access the
full site, especially to upload the videos and the pictures. But
anyone can send anything to this mobile ID and it will get
uploaded. It is just like sending SMS from your phone, but the
difference is there no restriction in which mail ID you send this
from, and by running a random script, it is just like you are
giving it complete access to your profile and will enable the
script to access almost everything in your profile, albeit your
password.
