The past few weeks , I had the (mis)fortune of travelling by popular trains. Being usually in no hurry I take trains that run at odd hours or travel by AC (provided something of my stipend is still left). But this time it was in the "reserved" second class seating of Lucknow to Delhi Gomti Express, which with its promise of being able to book second class tickets at even the last minute was an ideal choice.

The journey was the first time I was travelling in the 2S compartment in UP, while I have been in unreserved compartments where I have had to stand on 1 1/2 legs and not even move a bit, this was the first time I had to fight for my "reserved" seat. Now at this exact moment I would guess you are thinking. "Oh, come on kid, this is how it happens in India". Capture that thought.

Coming to the topic, as usual within a matter of minutes, the usual conversations started up, and railway conversations are the best source of crowd sourced opinions and hence the talks were more or less centered on popular topics, and as expected Team Anna and their fight against corruption was one of them.

Without proper grasp of the language (Hindi), I did not involve in the conversation, but was able to understand everything they said.

A large portion of the passengers supported JanLokpal, and were saying it was required, and that all Netas are corrupt, and that is the only way to become a Neta. The irony but however hard I tried to ignore, was dancing in front of me. We are here travelling ticketless and unreserved in a reserved compartment, succumbing overselves to the pull of comfort, and saving a few bucks, when we expect Netas to not get tempted by Crores of rupees.

The fact is in a way, we are used to this way of interaction, which we term "Adjusting" . We have absolutely no respect for the rules enforced, unless and until we think we may get caught. In short on a personal level we are corrupt.

Money, or power are just the medium of propogation of corruption,at the heart lies the willingness to do something easy and safe rather than what is right, and it is something we have been doing all along.

Only when we realise that not taking a platform ticket, because the queue was too long is the same as awarding a contract to the favourite, "The Easy Way Out". In fact it has become so common in India, that we no longer think of those as corruption, but just as neccessary rule breaking to live by.

I for one believe, that unless and until we see the one who gives a bribe, as morally corrupt as the person who is taking it , we will not end corruption. Yes you could argue that at many times we are forced to give it, but even avoiding that there are countless times we have the choice . If you do not believe me , go check in a railway platform how many have actual platform tickets.

Lokpal even if it is as powerful as it is supposed to be (I do not believe much in that), will not work unless we have the willingness to oppose somethings which we enjoyed all along.

For example if you take places where lower order corruption is lower, you can see that , those countries, tend to be the ones where even other rules (e.g. Even traffic rules) are followed better. It is this disrespect and disregard for the rules that we have to change.

All along we say that the persons at the top of the political/social pyramid are corrupt, but it is time we realised how corrupt we are at the bottom of the pyramid, and then only then when we do at least the bit of stopping personal corruption when we
can, can we even think of any anti-corruption legislation.

Once we are done that, I believe lower order corruption will reduce without any special legislation.So let us all stop the corruption at the bottom of the pyramid.

[For higher order corruption, it is a different case, and where I
believe Lokpal will be effective]

Thanks F.D. Roosevelt for the "Fortune at the BoP" Quote which I modified.
