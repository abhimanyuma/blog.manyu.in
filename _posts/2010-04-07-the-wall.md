I have had a few past blogging attempts and all of them have been spectacularly unsuccessful, The Wall might be and actually is a cliched title, but it has still been put as a reference to that wall on which we all scribbled on as children. (Even this idea has been shamelessly, lifted from my college magazine). As children our ideas know of no limits, but sadly we lack the knowledge to refine them. But as we gain more knowledge the limits seem to hold us even tighter that required. We begin to confine ourselves to a mundane and ordinary life. We just accept the greatest lie ever told "This is how life is, there is very little you can change".  Everyone believes in it, (paradoxically even me who just told you it's a ie),  the only question is to what extent.

This blog/wall is my attempt to make sure that all such ideas, I have, which could be wierd, ridiculous, totally non sensical get their chance at being heard. What better place other than the Internet where mosat of the current generation lives and works, to
publish the ideas.

If this blog goes well then this would be the stage for all those ideas,their stage of fame. But on the other hand if this blog ends up like many others on the obituary column, it would be their crystal tombstones where they have been put to rest for everyone to see, but no one really cares.
