Dear fellow Indians,

You have been free for a long 64 years.

You are free so long as you [don't trouble the government much](http://www.indianexpress.com/news/gujarat-riots-whistleblower-cop-sanjeev-bhatt-arrested/853964/).<br/>
You are free so long as you [don't ask the Chief Ministers question as such](http://www.indianexpress.com/news/man-arrested-for-daring-to-question-mamata-banerjee/987058/).

You are free so long as you [believe in some God](http://nirmukta.com/2009/03/05/religions-silencing-dissent-the-global-resurgence-of-blasphemy-laws/).<br/>
You are free so long as you [forgo truth and sense for the mob](http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/05/27/216761.html).

You are free so long as you [take care to eat the right food](http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/article3318160.ece).<br/>
You are free so long as you [quote from the right book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_assault_in_Kerala).

You are free so long as you [take care to censor your writing, and your thought](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8211038.stm).

You are free so long as you [take care to dress modestly and shut yourselves in your home](http://storyful.com/stories/22662).<br/>
You are free so long as you [uphold Indian tradition, and do not change with the time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Mangalore_pub_attack).

You are free so long as you [don't stand up for your rights](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=13&ved=0CJYBEBYwDA&url=http%3A%2F%2Findiatoday.intoday.in%2Fstory%2Fmanipur-iron-lady-irom-sharmila-fast%2F1%2F158841.html&ei=R3IrUMaAH8nJrAfmk4HwBg&usg=AFQjCNHzqE2OgQPqw8GbynJKaHC3i0-MTQ&sig2=VOc7RsXdj8vyXEo8ehFH9w).<br/>
You are free so long as you [don't put up a fight](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&sqi=2&ved=0CFcQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNandigram_violence&ei=wHMrUInjGs_trQeBr4GoBQ&usg=AFQjCNH5-D7b_TrgUibe3jTqqDsm6_ydbw&sig2=dDOfwCiHy2KosWF_3BwLgg)

You are free, as free as a dove.
