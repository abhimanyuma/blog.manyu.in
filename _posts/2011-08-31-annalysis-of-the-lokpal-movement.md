*[It's been a long time since I have blogged, and boy I have to tell it feels good to be back at  it again. This also marks my first post as a Master's Student at IIT Kanpur, but it is not directly related to it.]*

I am sure that there isn't even a single person in India who has not been following/loving/supporting/hating the movement by Anna Hazare for a strong Lokpal bill.

Now since countless people have come in support and against Anna Hazare and a lot has been discussed, I shall not go into any of that, but would like to talk about the following.

> How did "Team Anna" craft such a mass movement?

Yes, everyone has agreed on how successful the movement was in involving everyone from almost all walks of life, it raised huge public sentiment, now I shall try to with my *limited knowledge* explain why I think it was successful.

## Timing
The timing couldn't have been better, it was a time when newspapers and TV channels had a story of corruption like every other day, it was a time when govt. inaction was running high, and in short everyone wanted to "*Someone to do something about it*"  and this is where Anna Hazare came, he appeared as the *Someone doing something about corruption*

## Generalisation

The actual aim of the protest was to ensure the passing of the Jan Lokpal Bill, but they were able to project this as a *"Fight against Corruption"*. The advantage with this was that they could get people who opposed the Lokpal bill but was against
Corruption to be "Soft Supporters" - which means that even though they would not support it, they would also not voice their negative opinions, for they were asked *"Not to derail our common goal, arguing about the methods"*.

*It can be seen that the movement was organized by*"**India Against Corruption**" and not by "**India For Jan Lokpal**".

It was this high level generalization that allowed "Singapore is Great" because of Ombudsmen bill.even though Singapore at the time of application and India now are vastly different.

## The Only Hope

Team Anna Hazare was able to project "*Jan Lokpal*"  as the only effective way that we will have to correct corruption, they were able to say that it was either

- Continuance of rampant corruption
- Lokpal Bill (with all it's Pro's and Con's) and corruption


In few ways similar to the above method it also helped gaining significant "*Soft Supporters*".In fact this was a method that received got them very good supporters, but those who did not believe so did go against Lokpal. 

## The Opposition is wrong.

There is a dialogue in "Thank you for smoking" which goes like 
> To win an argument you don't need to show that you are right, just that your opposition is wrong - Thank You for Smoking 

This is something Team Anna utilized to perfection. When the Delhi Police came and arrested them, they were out there proving Delhi Police was wrong, they were out there proving the Prime Minister was not sincere in his efforts to fight corruption, they were out there proving that our very leaders were corrupt, once they did this they could say that they were fighting people who were *wrong*, and
this made them *right*.

This enabled them to wait till the Govt. stepped out of the line, and at that instance go against the government thereby drowning the valid points government has 

##Polarity

This is not exactly another trick, but as a result of the previous tricks they were able to have a bipolar *fight* with the government at one end, and the people at the other.

## Credibility

This is something they have put a lot into it, all except Anna who were there in the visible forefront, did have immense credibility backing them. This did have a "reflective goodness" effect on the bill. People who supported Anna where able to say, 
> Here is a lady who we all know is respectable and has done a lot for India, now if she supports this, then how can you think this would affect the nation in a negative way

Remember the "Rahul vs Ketjwal" posts in Facebook.

They were also able to take the credibility of Manmohan Singh and squash it, and this is why when he gave his speech it did have a lot of valid points, but since the sincerity of  MMS was under question; we all clapped when Arun Jaitely took his case in the RajyaSabha. For this single act enable them to say "*Oh my God ! He is bullshiting just so that you support him and not us*".

## Media Lobbying

The media were actively lobbied, and the media went on to air for more than 50% of the time news related to this. This generated even more interest/hype, which led more people to turn to TV, and thus having a self generated spiraling  advertisement flow, and viewership count

Infact if there is anyone who benefited from the movement the most, it would be the Media.

## The Power Behind

I strong believe that there was a well set up and well organized machinary that powered the whole movement which was not seen outside, because it is obvious that each of the negotiations, and moves were well thought of and pre planned. They expected the government to create problems, and anticipated it a lot so they could not only defend it but use it to their advantage.

Infact this power can be proud for they may not have won the war yet, but they have won the battle of getting all the people on their side.

These people may not be seen, but they have ensured that everything was setup, For e.g to quote an example that came in "The Hindu" ,by dropping for from "I am for Anna" they got "I am Anna" a more personal and rebellious feeling  statement, which helped the people to be part of the whole event more.

That is it even though what becomes of Corruption and Lokpal is yet to be seen we have seen the power of gatherings., I believe how the movement was scripted and now we can see what will happen to the movement and to corruption in India.
