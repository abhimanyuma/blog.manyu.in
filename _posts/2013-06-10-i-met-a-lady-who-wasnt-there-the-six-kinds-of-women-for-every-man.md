I saw this article [അമ്മയും പെങ്ങളും ഭാര്യയും കാമുകിയും മകളും വേശ്യയുമല്ലാതൊരുവള്‍](http://www.deshabhimani.com/periodicalContent1.php?id=291) by Mr. Sudeep K S, a lecturer at NIT Calicut, and now a scholar at IIT Bombay. I liked it so much. I am attempting a translation, without his permission, so that if I screw up, I don't want any blame going out. I have taken out a few regional references too, sorry about that. I tried to copy the original author's style but terribly broke down, and hence everything is as I would write it. 

This is aimed at the Indian society, and more so at the _traditional_ Indian grown ups


As far as men are concerned, women are a "problem". An issue. Every man is taught about women, and how to be *the perfect man* fit for the society from quite an early age. Everyone, your parents, your teachers, the priets, everyone want to teach you on how to be a *gentleman/lady*. This education starts from the moment the girls and boys sit, *safely* separated from each other at two sides of a classroom.

We take pride in *educating* our girls to "Always keep a distance from the boys", and we teach our boys that "Good boys don't even look at girls". All this is well and good, until puberty hits, and then ... everything goes for a ridiculous spin. The boys don't know what to do when they meet a girl, they do not know how to get to know her. He is conflicted in understanding and defining the relationship, and is forced to label and classify the relationship into the few categories he knows. 


## The Mother

Mothers are supposed to be the epitome of unhindered affection and love. These are the women who without a complaint accept us. They forgive when we are irresponsible, they take it upon themselves to correct our mistakes. They are the human incarnation of the virtue of patience. We turn to them in the hour of need. They feed us when we are hungry, keep our homes clean and even find *loving wives* for us. 

This is a relationship most men find *comfortable*. Teachers, mother of our friends, the older ladies next door, bosses, colleagues, and sometimes even our own wives are labelled as **mothers**.

It is upon these *mother wives* to forgive any misdeed the men may create, for they are merely tiny mischiefs of a young boy not knowing much. This is why wives are expected to forgive the small adventures of their husbands. It has to be but made clear at this point that the wives but yet should see them as *husbands*, and they are also taught how they should behave so that a *husband approves*, and hence a family where the wife is *well-mannered and forgiving* shall prosper. 

## The Lover (and The Wife)

**Romance** - take this away and half of the written world would be meaningless, much as been written about romance, and almost all of it by men. Love, and its various levels of physical, emotional and mental relationship is governed by a set of unwritten rules, a code of conduct the men have come up with for their relationship. **Romance** is often a drama, an expression of *love, lust and desire* where the lady plays the central character, but yet directed in it's entirety by the man. The lady is free to play any role, say anything, and be free, as long as the man approves. 

Marriage is the culmination of this holy relationship. This is the step romance *metamorphoses* into, a women in order to be saved by the man and given a new life,has to walk through an *agnipariksha* so that her *purity* (to be read as virginity) may be given a seal of approval by a man, who but is above and beyond any such tests of approval. And if heaven forbid any women was to not go into such a relationship, she immediately is the ire of the ever so caring society, any women not *protected* by man is clearly a suspicious entity. 

Romance is often the tool for self realization of men, a sort of coming of age.[M. Mukundan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Mukundan)in an article last year mentions how romance is often a tragedy (quickly followed by a marriage to someone else), and the need for creative and happier relationships. He talked at length about romance in art and literature.

> "When we talk about the romance of writers and artists, I see two faces in front of me - [Pablo Picasso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_picasso) and [Jean-Paul Sartre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre)."

He talks about Picasso

> Women and romance are inseparably intertwined in Picasso's art. Women were the inspiration for Picasso,and without women and romance, [Cubism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism) would have been an impossibility, and Picasso non-existent. A thousand thanks to women."

He then continues on to Jean-Paul Sartre and [Simone de Beauvoir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir). 

> "They gave a new lifestyle to couples, they didn't marry till death did them part, they shared everything, they had no secrets, and they loved each other deeply. They lived together as philosophers,writers and political activists till their death, and in death were buried in the same tomb"

Yet Simone de Beauvoir is conspicuously absent from the names that come to the mind of M Mukundan. He does introduce us to a new kind of meaningful romance, but even then love stays the mere tool for self realization of man.

## The Slut
(As in the slang, not the actual meaning)

It seems the accepted consensus is that dressing *modernly* and talking about women rights and women freedom, are the symptoms of *"Sexual Anarchy"*, with additional symptoms being travelling alone, keeping a company with men, wearing jeans and so on. These women are typically considered easy game, and it is every man's dream to *score* such a chick, and maintain a *relationship* provided your wife doesn't find out. Although in reality, most of these end in men scoring, a lot of other things like a sound trashing, and if lucky a few slaps as well. Then it is upto to the men to entertain the rest of his peers with *hot* tales of how *immoral* the women is. 

## The Sister

This isn't that bad an affair, and has the advantage that almost anybody can be labelled as your Sister (except your wife that is). Not only does it have a *moral acceptability* the previous classification lacks, it also gives a de facto privilege or responsibility of protecting the lady, and an excuse to intrude into her privacy with the *honest intentions* of keeping her from harm. If required you can even educate here with unsolicitated advices on how she ought to live her life. 

Sometimes even girls use this as a nice enough tactic to "Brotherzone" the people vying for them. It works until they realize that a "brother" is much more irritating than a random guy behind you. For people in North India, this is pretty much why girls look forward to Raksha Bandhan. 

## The Daughter

This category is often reserved for women much younger to us like the daughters of friends or relatives, and brings with it roughly the same entitlements as that awarded by being a brother, but you can always pay the wisdom card to be more authoritative. Wives who are yet to see the _real world _can also be classified as daughters (and is much safer than classifying them as sister). 

<hr/>

The moment we interact with a women in a public setting, our mind begins to desperately want to classify them into one of these labels, so that we can slowly and surely enforce our dominance. Anyone a colleague, a police women, a teacher, a principal anyone, has to be one of these labels or else it just doesn't feel right. For a moment to think of some women as equal or someone with power over us, would not bring good images into our heads, especially if you are from the 60s or the 70s. 

Relationships need not be classified into any of these labels. and that is where the youngsters are leading the way. These rules seems not to apply to the new *Internet/Mobile Generation*, For they don't want any of these classifications, they have thrown all of them out in favour of being **friends**. No longer is being together with a person of the opposite sex on campus, or spotting them anywhere an indication of lovers, it is just a few friends hanging out, and given the equal nature of the relationship, this classification allows for over a thousand ways to label the relationship (that is till the society allows for it to continue)

This change may well be the start of a social revolution, a start of the revolution where women cease to be the tools for the self realization of men. A start of a revolution where men too ceases to be kept away from important things. In such a world we would be able to freely share everything - World matters, the household matters, literature, gossip, movies, serials, and anything else. The air in such a world would carry the fragrance of freedom for both sexes, and we would begin to fly. Let us not be the chains that holds a society that is ready to take off
