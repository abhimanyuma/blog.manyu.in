Take a normal guy, crush him down to half the size, beat all the
sanity out of him, and add a passion for anything technical and
crazy. Well that should roughly be me. Insane , Wierd, Non Sensical
and as said in the Blog header proud of it all.I am supposedly
-doing my Bachelors in Computers Science at National Institute of
Technology, Calicut.-done with my BTech from NIT Calicut.  Well it
was a great place to enjoy the best years of your lives and to make
some good friends, and to get a degree in the process. (You could
also study if you want to). But right now I am at IIT Kanpur doing
by Masters again in Computer Science, and hoping to specialize in
algorithms.To add to it I am highly nerdy, and my awesome stuff
might not be like yours. You might call them BORING.
