Well it happens to all of us, to some of us in a bad way, and to
some in the worst way possible way , there are 3 types of people
who you should avoid from your Facebook friend list at all cost,
calling them Y-People for short (Short for Y did these People even
think of joining Facebook)
<ol>
    <li>
Family
</li>
    <li>
Faculty
</li>
    <li>
Manager/Boss
</li>
</ol>
What people fail to realise is that Facebook is a "Virtual You" and
is pretty much alive, and byting. We the normal people in our real
lives have multiples faces, one to be cool, one to be responsible,
one to be romantic and so on. But in Facebook all these persons
blend into one single profile, and hence the problem starts.
<!--more-->

The problem which is very similar to a disease attacks in the
following ways

Step 1: The Y-people join Facebook, and as is usually the case find
very few of their "friends" on Facebook.

Step 2: They now turn to your account, this is where you should get
really afraid, because even if you are not their friend most of the
people have set wall visibility to public.

Step 3: The real problem starts when they send you a friend
request. You might just see it as a friend request but what it
actually says is "HEY I AM TRYING TO BE COOL & MODERN", which would
be cool but the fact remains they aren't.

Step 4:  You make some random updates to your profile which can
include the following.

The only good thing is the Y-People don't comment on your walls,
but usually either send you a message or next time you see them,
they go "Hmmm.... You seem to be really active on Facebook, but you
know what you can be cool even without ................" saying the
F word, doing what you did in the pic, having a girlfriend and so
on.

<span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:24px;">These
are people who you might meet everyday so there is no way by which
you can NOT accept their requests, and since these guys (esp.
Family and Faculties) have few friends (why they have few friends
makes the topic of discussion of another blog) your status update
from even few days back might be in their Notifications.
</span></span>

<span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:24px;">So
the question, how do we make them believe you are their friend but
at the same time you keep yourselves safe ?? </span></span> h3.
*Solution : Facebook Lists*

Lists help you group people according to how you know them.

Step 1: Create a list by going to Account \>\> Edit Friends.

Step 2: Click on the "Create a list" button.

Button"]<a href="http://blog.manyu.in/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fb5.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-117" title="Create List Button" src="http://blog.manyu.in/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fb5.png" alt="Create List Button" width="268" height="195" /></a>[/caption]

<span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:24px;">Step
3: Make a group "Stay Away From Me".</span></span>

<span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:24px;">
</span></span>

src="http://blog.manyu.in/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fb6.png"
alt="New List Dialogue" width="468" height="432" /\></a>[/caption]

Step 4: Now go to Account \>\> Privacy Settings \>\> Customise
Settings. Initially make sure all the things we customise  are set
to friends since otherwise it might cause problems. (Read Note 4)

Step 5: Select the section you want "extra-privacy" in and select
customise.

[caption id="attachment\_121" align="aligncenter" width="568"
caption="Select Customise
Option"]<a href="http://blog.manyu.in/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fb7.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-121" title="Select Customise Option" src="http://blog.manyu.in/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fb7.png" alt="Select Customise Option" width="568" height="177" /></a>[/caption]

Step 6: Now Type "Stay away from me" in Hide from these people and
select the group, apply this to as many things as you need.

Now you are done, and you have better privacy.

Step 7: You can also do this for individual status messages, by
clicking the lock symbol under the status message update box.

You can also use this is post few status message from time to time
without the usual customisation, so that the "Stay Away From Me"
people think you are still normally friends with them.

Step 8: You can also use this to hide from them in the chat, by
moving the slider to the the right. (Note: This will not work if
they belong to multiple lists, and is allowed in at least one).

That's it I think and covers pretty much everything.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Additional Notes</span>

1.  When you tag someone in a post they are hidden from, they will
    get to know that they are tagged, but will not be able to see the
    post.

[caption id="attachment\_128" align="aligncenter" width="626"
caption="He can't see the post he is tagged in
"]<a href="http://blog.manyu.in/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fb11.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-128" title="He can't see the post he is tagged in " src="http://blog.manyu.in/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fb11.png" alt="He can't see the post he is tagged in " width="626" height="266" /></a>[/caption]

2.  You can use this in the reverse manner, so that you can be
    online on chat to that special someone, while being offline to all
    the rest, and to send private message in the wall itself.

3.  You can also use this function to avoid stalkers that you just
    cannot block. (Intended at girls mainly).

4.  Beware of Mutual Friends between you and these people since
    those people might mention "You saw Mr. Guys's Status ??" and ruin
    the whole setup.
