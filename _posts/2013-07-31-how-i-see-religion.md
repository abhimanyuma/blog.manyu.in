I just thought I wanted to share how I saw religion. 

Imagine a beautiful garden that you can walk through, it has beautiful flowers, a nice pond with a few lillies, some flowers you may not like too. Nice little birds, small animals, and so on and on. This is not religion, it is culture. The flowers, plants and other animals were the beautiful books, poems, stories, scientific discoveries, legal system, food and cuisine, social structure and so on. 

People were free to come from one place to another, wander through each garden. Some people tried to take home some of the plants, they liked, few of them were able to get it to their homeland, few others, did not grow as well there. 

Now the gardens are community owned, and community run, and a few people in the community want to get power. They assemble a few of their friends, and starts building a wall around this garden.Let us call them the landlords. They call the wall "God" and it is tasked with the job of protecting the garden from any person, and now the landlords, want an entry fee from the people. It can either be cash or service. 

Skilled gardners though are in demand, for many landlords compete to bring them to their garden and nuture it, they are given cash and services, and in return, the create more beautiful flowers in the garden. 

The landlords see that his income has gone down, and oh why is it? He sees that someone else has opened up a similar garden with less fees somewhere, down the road, he claims heresy, the believes he has the best flowers, and that the other landlord, is infringing on his income. He goes to war, attacks the walls of the other garden, rips out the flowers, burns the animals. 

Finally one is emerged as victor, and the other rebuilts his garden, but this time, the design is by the victor, and a portion of the entry fees goes toward the victor. 

Isolated pockets of flora and fauna, are deemed to be risky without the protection of the walled garden, they are brough in either by promising a better life, or by force into the walled gardens, for some, it is welcome change to the risks of the outside world, but many animals merely lement their loss of freedom. 

Sometimes, fights break out and a deputy of the landlord, runs aways, and starts a new garden, with a few minor changes, the new owner doesn't seem to like the lillies, so he swaps them for tulips, and invites all tulip lovers, to his new garden, for tulips were banned in the old one. 

Once the landlords learn of countries far away, he sends people to create a garden, idential to his in that nation, so everyone may know the beauty of what he has. They are succesfull in some aspects, but some of the animals can't adapt, and so they swap them for the animal they find there, and the same with few of the plants. 

Then there are the infidels, the people who don't seem to like the fact that the gardens are walled. So one fine day, they take a closer look at the walls, and sees that the walls are merely an illusion of light, and they are completely imaginary. They start going through the walls, and enjoying the flowers of not just one garden, but of many many gardens, and even create gardens without any walls. 

This hurts the landlords for they have grown quite rich and quite lazy on the incomes, but this population of free gardens are growing and growing.
