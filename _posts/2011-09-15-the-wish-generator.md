Ahh ... birthdays were such a wonderful thing, your closest friends
and family, party, phone calls, special yet private. Now thanks to
Facebook all of it is ruined.

I would have to say Facebook is how I now remember birthdays. Also
I now generally wish a lot more people than without facebook. 
Thank You Facebook, but you know once I start wishing I just start
running out of words to wish the person. Had I known that person
really really well I could have wished him with a truly personal
message, naah not here. So what I need is a "Facebook Birthday Wish
Generator" that generates wishes automatically and gives it to me
so that yup I can just copy paste it on other people's wall.
<!--more-->

Being a CS guy I thought may be I should code one and here is it
people, enter the name, the nick and it will generate a pretty much
random birthday wish. I only have a few key words but still that
should give you about 20 - 30 unique wishes. Right now it is more
oriented towards the guys, but it can be made either ways, Did I
mention that it is way away from perfect.

*Next time you people wish me, please make sure you DON'T USE THIS.*

The point of this is that, Be more creative everyone !!!

*[Update : The point here was not to come up with a great wish generator, as many of you think, but that , MY SUCKY WISH GENERATOR CAN DO BETTER THAN YOU PEOPLE] *

*[Update : The GENERATOR was lost while moving to new host, wait for some time please]*

Thanks to all the people's wall who I have scavenged for patterns.
