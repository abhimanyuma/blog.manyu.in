So a recent supposed _report_ on Huffington Post put Sonia Gandhi’s wealth at a healthy $2 Billion ( ₹ 12,500 Crores), they have since retracted the report, after they found out that the source was _unreliable_, which is newspaper-speak for 
> “The number came from an intern who did a search on the Internet for this”. 
People in India but have been nevertheless angry about it, and media in India are still reporting it, willfully ignorant of the retraction. Who cares when you get so many views (Which is also why I am publishing this) I say to all those people, that you are unnecessarily worrying, the report if true is a good thing. Here is why 

1. All you people accusing her of corruption all she took from each person in India was just 2$ (₹ 125/- only), after guaranteeing us [employment][1] and [food][2], don’t you think she deserved it. 
2. Given that rupee has been falling, don’t you think it is good that our country has foreign deposits, in one of the most stable currencies in the world? Soniaji’s wealth is our country’s wealth, and if our country’s wealth is Soniaji’s wealth. After all isn’t it all part of India’s greatest family? 
3. Shashi Tharoor talked about “_[Soft Power of India][3]_”and what better way to have it, than having one of the richest politicians in the world belonging to India. Imagine all the free press we will be getting. For once, they are not doing the usual cliche of search for hunger and poverty pics, but putting us in the wealthiest group. 
4. I checked the list, there is only a single lady there, Queen Elizabeth, what better way to say f’ck you to our erstwhile oppressors and rulers than to have the current rulers making more wealth. 
5. We all know that Indian’s are very bad at handling money, we mostly drink it away, so isn’t it good practice that someone with so much of money is keeping it safe in a bank which we can not touch. I am sure that should India need, our dear Soniaji will not hesitate to bring all the money back to India.
6. China and Pakistan are nowhere in the list, take that you international land mafias, we have got Gandhi, and you shall be made fun of. This is what you get for stealing land from India. 
7. Indians also need not worry about the future of the money, the half of the money will eventually go to Priyanka Vadra and Robert Vadra(a.k.a The greatest entrepreneur in the world) is known for converting a few crores into a few hundred crores, with such capability imagine what he could do with $1 Billion, who knows we may have the richest person in the world title coming back. Also the No.1 Title of Vladimir Putin in this list should be ours.
8. The other $1 Billion would go to Rahul Gandhi, who I am expecting would keep it for when he become old, and given that Rahulji is a 43 year old “youth leader”, I have no clue whether that would even happen in my lifetime (or even probably his). 
9. What better story to tell your kids than someone who was a normal lady in Italy, fell in love with Prince Charming and became the richest lady politician. This is the stuff inspirational movies are made out of. I foresee the scope for 2-3 Fairness Ads, a couple of Facewash ads, and a deodorant commercial out of this. 

So there you have it guys, while there is no proof that Sonia Gandhi has 12500 crores in her purse, we do now know that if she did, it would be really good for India. So here is one person hoping that the report is true, and Sonia Gandhi is hiding the money just like parents hiding the kids birthday gift, and as we all know each and every Indian is Soniaji’s kid. Finally so “Jai Bolo Soniaji Ki”.
