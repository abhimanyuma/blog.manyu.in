I know the status doesn't make much sense, but it in general conveys what I have often felt. Often people rile up for a cause, they hold so dear to the heart, they pursue it as though it is the only thing in the world, and they change the world as you see it, BUT not in the way they ever wanted.

Egypt is the best example in this regard, just over a year ago, Egypt filled the papers. Egypt was what everybody was talking about, the "revolution" for freeing Egypt from the clutches of its brutal dictator was what everybody was interested in and supported wholeheartedly. BUT look at Egypt now, sure it has got itself free of Hossini Mubarak, but another dictator has taken their place, the Egyptian army head. The situation is no different in Egypt. People are still NOT getting their basic human rights. Protesters are still detained, and even killed. Nothing has changed, except for the guy at the top. The same human rights violation, the same dictatorship, but under a different leadership.

Hence when you ask me about change, and what it can bring about, the greatest thing I fear is the change that is actually no change at all.

P.S : Excuse the mistakes.
