It is said that “Villians have never won in history” but it has
also been said that it because “It is the victorious that write
history”.

## Hitler's Speech at the Formation of Global Reichstag
 
..<span class="pull-right">24<sup>th</sup> October 1945, Berlin, Germany</span>

*The war that had held the world in terror has finally ended. Germany, has been victorious. For long my nation had suffered, under the conditions enforced by forces alien to it. It's sovereignty had been made worth to nothing, by countries that took pride in making profit out of the colonies it controlled. Germany had been under the rule of incapable and those who feared to question the injustice Germany was subjected to. We had people within Germany who were not true to their nation, who kept their religious views above the nation and above it's interests. As a result my nation suffered for a long 30 years. But now everything has changed, Germany has returned to be the true leaders of the new world order.*

*The war was never easy for us, with all the major nations, the USSR, the USA, the British and the French against us, but we showed them that all of them combined would not even be able to question our superiority, for our power comes from the noble race we belong to, the Aryans. We proved to the world beyond doubt our capability and intelligence. We should the Jews that traitors to any nation would not be taken lightly.*

*Now to all the nations assembled here, I ask you to throw away the chains that have bound you to these colonial powers. Now that they have been left to no more than an excuse of a nation, find identity for yourselves, and unite under the banner of the great Global Reichstag.*

*For those in doubt look at how we have transformed Europe, once a place of umpteen nations bickering at each other, it is now a place of peace. Europe now isn't 100 nations fighting for their selfish desire, it is Germany, the land of righteousness and peace.*

*The United States, who were cruel enough to use nuclear weapons on Japan have now been paid back, they have been brought to their knees by our own nuclear weapons, and are now probably wondering why they even entered the war which was none of their business.*

*Finally I ask everyone here to spare a minute to remember the soldiers of the Axis powers that have laid down their lives to make today possible, to make the new world of peace possible.*

*Long live the New World Order, Long Live Germany.*
