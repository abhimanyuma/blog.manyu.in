The love of religions for money is legendary. To quote the
legendary [George Carlin](http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html)

> Think about it! Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time! - But HeÂ  *loves* you. He loves you. He loves you and NEEDS YOUR MONEY.

Many people have attributed it to various things, but I think it is essential because they are the same, so let us compare.

- God has no actual power ,only perceived power because people believe it has. Money has [no actual value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_currency) only perceived value because people believe it has.
- God is backed by religious institutions who almost everyone believes is composed of total idiots. Money is backed by government who almost everyone believe is composed of total idiots.
- Money is a easy way to get to the the top of a religious institution. Religious institution is a way to get to the top of the wealth pyramid.
- Mere mortals(or the common man) should work hard both for their god and money.
- God is guaranteed to you by few pieces of paper. Money is guaranteed to you by few pieces of paper.

The major difference being.

- It is a sin to do bad things for money. It is holy to do bad things for your God

Essentially it is because both of are powerful and motivating concepts, and just concepts.
