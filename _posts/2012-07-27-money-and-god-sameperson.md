The love of religions for money is legendary. To quote the
legendary
<a title="George Carlin" href="http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html" target="_blank">George
Carlin</a>, bq. Think about it! Religion has actually convinced
people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches
everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man
has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if
you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of
fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will
send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry
forever and ever 'til the end of time! - But He  *loves* you. He
loves you. He \_loves \_you and NEEDS YOUR MONEY. Many people have
attributed it to various things, but I think it is essential
because they are the same, so let us compare.
<ol>
    <li>
God has no actual power ,only perceived power because people
believe it has. Money has
<a title="Fiat Currency" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_currency" target="_blank">no
actual value</a>  only perceived value because people believe it
has.
</li>
    <li>
God is backed by religious institutions who almost everyone
believes is composed of total idiots. Money is backed by government
who almost everyone believe is composed of total idiots.
</li>
    <li>
Money is a easy way to get to the the top of a religious
institution. Religious institution is a way to get to the top of
the wealth pyramid.
</li>
    <li>
Mere mortals(or the common man) should work hard both for their god
and money.
</li>
    <li>
God is guaranteed to you by few pieces of paper. Money is
guaranteed to you by few pieces of paper.
</li>
</ol>
The major difference being.
<ol>
    <li>
It is a sin to do bad things for money. It is holy to do bad things
for your God
</li>
</ol>
Essentially it is because both of are powerful and motivating
concepts, and just concepts.
