Everyday during this World Cup the papers have had the same headlines over and over again, so much that even the people have gone tired of it, "Referee Error, FIFA should use a video referee". Now FIFA has given the explanation that referee decision challenges will stop the speed and beauty of the game, and so no matter what the technology they have, THEY CANNOT USE THEM. Well I do not believe them for one sec, and I have my solid reason for believing so. I believe FIFA has been taken over by a few people here are the possible hijackers of FIFA.


## The Bookies

This might be the most logical conspiracy theory, bookies have already got huge money, so they will try to do what they can to stop the ones on which most money has been bet, from advancing.

Their worst day was when they forced to go against England, only to find out that the team itself was more actively involved in ensuring a negative result. So a warning to all English fans, stop betting on them and may be they would at least be in the good books of the referee.

## The Indian Govt.

Why isn't FIFA using the technology ? 

Actually FIFA is, the cameras and the sensors for their latest fourth referee has been bought, but as with everything in Indian Govt., "Newton's Fourth Law" applies to it,"*Anything and Everything worth something if sold, will remain only on paper, until and unless an external media does a scoop, and on application of such a scoop it will exist for a period inversely proportional to the their chance in the coming elections*".

The referees, have also been given the special "How-to-be-a-jerk" coaching given to all govt. officials, and will continue to behave so for they believe Red Cards, and Goal Denials are allowed to them as per protocol.There is however good news, since the referees would most probably go on strike demanding pay rise, and normal football can once again resume.There is also a fourth referee on the payroll, as again just on paper, just that even though having marked attendance in every match, he is at his brother's wedding in India.

My final warning is to the team who lifts the cup, the cup is going to be a FAKE with roll gold, the original would have already reached a numbered Swiss account.

The above two theory have all it takes to be real, but my bet is on the following one.

## Bollywood

For e.g., take this basic story line

Introduce 2 heroes both who are fighting to get the beautiful,sexy and dumb female who is usually economically and religiously opposite to the heroes. They are really good friends, but this female would now cause all the fight between them. Even with all this the movie seems bland, so enter our villain, he will as is the case, offer one of them help, and strive to make them fight each other. The heroine finally makes her choice, and goes to her hero, and the other-almost-dead-from-villain-hero finally makes peace with the couple.

Just like this when saw the world cup, he asked "Where the fcuk is the villain ?", and so he goes to the referees and invites them over to the dark side, who already pissed with the fact that they are no longer the  men-in-black,  join forces with FIFA (Filmy International Football Association).

They also ensure that they have enough controversy to stay in the headlines of the news and gossip columns, expect Maradonna to be in a messy relation with Messi soon.

Yeah, and did I tell you FIFA also gave all the players pretty good acting lessons, so when they have been tackled they let the world know they are hurt, the hero always gathers sympathy. Gone are the days of a silent tackle, dramatics shall now take center stage. In fact they have become so good at acting, that [Faking News](http://www.fakingnews.com/2010/06/listless-bollywood-stars-head-to-south-africa-for-acting-tips/) reports that Bollywood actors now take lessons from them

So with all this in mind, I would have to say tough luck to the referee of the finals, coz the villain will get beaten in the end, and the Golden Boot will go to Sharukh Khan.

The above scenario doesn't seem logical ?? Well, when the hell has Bollywood ever been logical?
