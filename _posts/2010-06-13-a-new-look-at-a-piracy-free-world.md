Microsoft as usual is still continuing to fight it's battle against Piracy, which they say is a crime. But I have a feeling that making the software world free of priracy might be like Terminator, as in working towards a goal that finally kills you.

Linux had been predicted to overtake and pin down Windows, with the slight problem that this was supposed to happen a decade ago, and even though Linux has got better, they are not close enough even now. They may overtake Windows in the future but not quite that soon. But this prediction has done it's share of good more actually for Windows users, Microsoft accepted fact that there are other OSes and started putting more effort into their products to make it usable and started to develop better products so that people will buy them. The reason Windows is still supreme is mainly the immense software market out there for Windows, and more importantly the fact that most people believe that Windows = OS, they just don't want to change something they are really good at. So anything different from Windows is doing it the wrong way.

Now put a piracy free world at stake, the Windows user is suddenly finding that almost all the software he is using is now restricted and unavailable. Now he is faced with a dilemma (Microsoft Office at Rs.9000 to Open Office at Rs.0) or (Photoshop at Rs. 40,000 to Gimp at Rs.0). I personally have found MS Office and Photoshop to be better, but with this much of a price difference I might not fancy that,I will settle for the close second, and once the customer base of the free softwares increase, they will start getting better and better. So now an average user has his Computer loaded with free softwares. Now just like proprietary softwares shares a relationship with Windows, the same can be said about Linux and Free Softwares. Windows is never a better operating system than Linux, it is just a different operating system. Now once the user will start thinking, "Why he needs to spend cash for just his OS, when he can get a free OS that runs all of his softwares ?? " (and some of them even better), and once you take value for money into consideration, Windows is no longer in the picture. Once the average user stops using Windows the result will gradually ripple to corporations and governments who are actually the onces that buys Windows and other softwares legally, and thada Windows would have just killed itself.

So advice to all Free Software enthusiast, just work on crushing piracy your work is done. 

> Do I believe this will happen ? No, since I believe piracy is
something that is not solvable.
