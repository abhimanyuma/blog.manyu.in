Microsoft as usual is still continuing to fight it's battle against
Piracy, which they say is a crime. But I have a feeling that making
the software world free of priracy might be like Terminator, as in
working towards a goal that finally kills you.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Linux had been predicted to overtake and pin down Windows, with the
slight problem that this was supposed to happen a decade ago, and
even though Linux has got better, they are not close enough even
now. They may overtake Windows in the future but not quite that
soon. But this prediction has done it's share of good more actually
for Windows users, Microsoft accepted fact that there are other
OSes and started putting more effort into their products to make it
usable and started to develop better products so that people will
buy them. The reason Windows is still supreme is mainly the immense
software market out there for Windows, and more importantly the
fact that most people believe that Windows = OS, they just don't
want to change something they are really good at. So anything
different from Windows is doing it the wrong way.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><!--more-->
Now put a piracy free world at stake, the Windows user is suddenly
finding that almost all the software he is using is now restricted
and unavailable. Now he is faced with a dilemma (Microsoft Office
at Rs.9000 to Open Office at Rs.0) or (Photoshop at Rs. 40,000 to
Gimp at Rs.0). I personally have found MS Office and Photoshop to
be better, but with this much of a price difference I might not
fancy that,I will settle for the close second, and once the
customer base of the free softwares increase, they will start
getting better and better. So now an average user has his Computer
loaded with free softwares. Now just like proprietary softwares
shares a relationship with Windows, the same can be said about
Linux and Free Softwares. Windows is never a better operating
system than Linux, it is just a different operating system. Now
once the user will start thinking, "Why he needs to spend cash for
just his OS, when he can get a free OS that runs all of his
softwares ?? " (and some of them even better), and once you take
value for money into consideration, Windows is no longer in the
picture. Once the average user stops using Windows the result will
gradually ripple to corporations and governments who are actually
the onces that buys Windows and other softwares legally, and thada
Windows would have just killed itself.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
So advice to all Free Software enthusiast, just work on crushing
piracy your work is done.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Do I believe this will happen ? No, since I believe piracy is
something that is not solvable.
