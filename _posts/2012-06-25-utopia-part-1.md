[Utopia = Modern Day Indian Politics + 1984]

> India, today is a multi cultural diverse society, and for all of us to co-exist, it is important that we forgo some of our personal freedoms for the greater good of the society. Today while being at the desk of “Citizen Today”, India's most read magazine, I look back on the day I took over the office and my name before that
>
> I was born as Surya Narayanan, the name I was given, when I was 28 days old, by my great-grandfather, Krishnavarma Raja, the last of the rulers of the princely state of Cochin.
>
> When I took office as the editor of “Citizen Today”, I was always greeted as “Suryaji Namaskar”, which as pointed out by the respected religious group ABC, was a thin veiled reference to idol worship. It was only when they pointed it out, that I realized the importance of having a neutral name in a publication house, where people of various groups, religions, regions worked. I was someone everyone in the office looked up to, and who everyone had to address, and it was hence important that I have a name everyone accepted. More over I was the face of a national publication, and hence it is the society who should have a say in what my name is.*
>
> It is for this reason that I am thankful that we today have the “Government Names Department”, since the government being the true representative of the people, and providing for it's citizens should have the right over the names of its citizens. Any person of this nation, is representing the nation, to the outside world,a name is his identity, and hence part of the identity of the nation.
>
> I then choose “Citizen : 03071972” as a name since Guideline (43 D) in the Secular Names Act 2013 states that “A person may also choose as his name - his date of birth, his place of birth, or his UID number” . After a few weeks with this name it was the national party BHP which pointed out that the 3<sup>rd</sup> of July 1972, was also the day on which India signed the "Shimla Agreement" , that established the Line of Control, this according to them, was openly and publicly supporting Pakistan occupied Kashmir, and the separatist movement involved - making me one of the greatest traitors of the nation. They felt such a man handling an office of a publication house, would lead to such ideas flowing down to the masses, they saw this as a campaign to print the date on every issue of the magazine we published, when I signed the editors column.
>
> I wrote to the government in view of the protests, and I am happy to write that in the best interest of the nation, they have decided that I be born on 3<sup>rd</sup> July 1973.
>
> The following steps I took have not been easy on me, personally I feel like I have lost something along with the name, the heritage, the family and a lot more, but I realize that it is something that is required to take the nation forward as a whole, for only if each and every one of us is united without any personal differences can we as a nation progress.
>
> So I ask you dear friends, the future of our nation, the ones who shall be running the country to conform to the requirements of the society and to be what is expected of you from the society and the nation.*
>
> Jai Hind

Surya finished his speech, and came back to his seat, he hated the addresses,he hated himself for giving it, he hated the fact that he had to give it almost every month, but they were part of the little favours the government expected him to do in return for allowing his magazine to function.
