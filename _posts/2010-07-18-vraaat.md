*[This is the situation, almost everyone has seen the movie Inception and are facebooking about it, so I was upset that I won't be able to see it in Chennai and the fact that I would have to see it in Calicut, where honestly all theaters suck big time (I am from Calicut), made me shut off fb and turn to some movie. I first thought of watching Dark Knight on my comp, then somehow thought it would be better to watch some "Non-Chirstopher-Nolan" movie and started on AVATAR. I agree that Avatar is a thing of the past and as per the unwritten rule of the blogging brotherhood , I shouldn't speak about it, but what the hell ??]*

The movie as you all know is about how man in 2157 (or some year) has lost it's morals and a corporation starts to kill the inhabitants of a planet, and try to destroy a holy tree so they can have unobtannium which they can sell back in Earth at $ 20 million/ kilo. The movie was rumored to be part of a triplet. Now coming back to what I discovered, James Cameroon actually made a template in the movie, and the shots could be rearranged, and the dialogues changed a bit, and we would be able to come up with a totally different theme based on the same story. So sit back for my version
called VRAAT.

**Old Reason** : Profit from Unobtannium

**New Reason** : Unobtannium (they are the roots of the holy tree) has been found as the only cure to Chimera, a new disease that has already killed 2 billion of the earth's 12 billion population.

**Old Na'avi** : A society in total peace and harmony with nature and themselves, and an Utopian society.

**New Na'avi** : Same as the above, but also a closed society that hates visitors.

That said let me get to my new story.

Humans in their desperate search for Unobtannium finally reach Pandora, and viola, the planet has it and in abundance, but it is at the root of their holiest tree. So the humans start approaching the N'aavis peacefully but the N'aavis who don't like visitors curse them and turn the humans into N'aavis, and these people unable to cope up with their new bodies return to base station and stay in the training camp (Seen in the start). One new scene might be required here.

Our hero James, has been bought to replace his one brother (just like in Avatar), but here because his brother had made quite good progress in the talks, before getting killed by the wild animals of Pandora (remember the "Running from that Animal scene", here it is just scary and not funny). Yet he tries his best to fake that he is actually his injured brother but things go horribly wrong and they punish him too by transforming him into one of their own, but somehow he can walk and run with his new body and hence decides to stay.

This is when Eywa(Mother Nature) makes the sign that he is accepted, something she did not do for any of the rest and hence decides to teach him the N'aavi ways. The romance between James and Naitiri can continue as such and without any change, even upto the point of James riding the Grand Dragon. (This covers everything till the end)

## The end

The humans finding that their peaceful methods are failing turn to violent offensives but finds them thoroughly and completely beaten, and the rest of the movie continues as such. So they gather all their force and try a last ditch effort to get some N'aavi, but they are getting their asses kicked by the animals of the planet (In my version this appears first), but James talks to Eywa through his USB cord thing and convinces her/him/it that their goals are selfless and pure, Eywa moved through it's soul stops all the animals fighting but they still have the N'aavis to deal with, and here the humans manage some success but even now are almost beaten.  This is when the unthinkable happens and the holy tree falls down (change of reason again but the same scene) and all the N'aavis here the following in their heads  "This is Eywa, Thou N'aavis arth too selfish hence I destroy myself" and now the big tree falls down, the humans get their Unobtannium, the N'aavis learn their lesson and loves forces the hero to stay back.

Hence ends the VRAATH of nature.
