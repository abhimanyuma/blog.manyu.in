 Another vacations have just come around, and as usual the shine of the vacations have dimmed, and I am as usual bored and jobless, and blogging. Now my jobless soul starts watching How I Met Your Mother, and then Season 3 Episode 11, comes “The Platinum Rule”, which explains, Why you should “Never ever, ever, ever love 'thy' neighbour ”. It explains how you should never ever date you might have to be deal with on a daily basis. Now that I am smack in the middle of vacations, I think the eight phases of **The Platinum Rule** applies to my precious vacations, remember it was a “Don't Date rule”. For those of you who don;t know what that is, here is it's [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platinum_Rule_%28How_I_Met_Your_Mother%29).


1. **Attraction** –The exams have totally taken their toll on you, all the end semester submissions have been so hard you have hardly had the time to copy,from some 9 pointer who is busy revising. So you just want to end it all and vacations seem like the perfect thing ahead, lots of time to relax, and you believe being jobless is much better than cramming your head with subjects you are totally going to forget the moment you write the exam, (or in many cases just before you write the exams).

2. **Bargaining** – Now you bargain with your own self, on how this year it is going to be different, on how you are going to rock each and every single day of the vacation, and have a legendary vacation.You say to yourselves that you have got it totally planned out with trips and other crazy stuffs.

3. **Submission** – You finally have finished off your last bloody exam, (probably even got screwed in that paper) but hell, this would be your most awesome day, you are finally free, of the clutches of the bitch called exams and you just wanna take it in one bite at a time. Your vacations have come, and you have welcomed them home, Gladly.

4. **Perks** – The first few days of vacation are the most awesome, you finally get to watch that movie, and sleep till mid noon (you could also probably do these if you take CS @ NIT Calicut btw), and go on wild trips, you are having one crazy day after another, after another.

5. **Tipping Point** – This is when you have seen all the movies in your collection, and in the absence of your hostel lan, have nothing more to do than watch HBO and Star for what they decide to give you. You have probably run out of money and that means no more exciting trips, and the worst part of all, any family function of that relative's brother's wife's sister's dad's family friend's..... that you don't want to go to, but would sadly have to because you have no other excuse to give. 


6. **Purgatory** –

 You finally accept that there is no way out of it, and put on your best “Ah ! I know you look” at that weird looking guy's wedding, and you think it will somehow get better, but NO,curse you, your mother,( or your sister, or maybe your cousin or somebody) took you out for their N hours of shopping (your 100N hours of purgatory) when all you can do is fall asleep giving the saree/churidar salesman, the “How/Why/When did I even agree to this" look. The worst part is when you realise you still have a long way to go for the vacations to end.

7. **Confrontation** – You end up getting so pissed that you finally go back to college even if it's closed to do some god damn project, or spent all your time in sleeping and the rest of the time just taking out all your anger on the food. You just beg and beg to somehow go on the next trip.

8. **Fallout** – You realise that you have been the reason you got bored you stop attending that relative's relative's family functions, you protest against going out with someone for their shopping, and all of them end up cursing you. “It is your vacation and you don't have time for this” . There it is one more vacation well spent.
