The past few weeks have witnessed a world where the word *wiki* is
more likely to be followed by *leaks* than *pedia*. The US and
other governments have come out full force against this cyber
whistle blower. They have accused them of theft and of putting
lives in danger (\_Having blood on their hands \_as US Military
would like to call it). Yet I believe the threat the governments
are facing is not Wikileaks but the fact that it was \_leakable.
\_If a jewelery store is robbed then the fault lies with the
thieves alone, but if someone steals from a military base, the
fault lies with both the base, and the thieves.

Wikileaks in its entirety was done by just a group of journalists,
and volunteers *who may or may not have hidden connections*. If
those people were able to leak such documents which the countries
have marked "highly confidential" then how is it that we believe
that people with even greater resources for disposal including
terrorists, and other nations, have no access to the same documents
?  The people in whose hand this information might be a weapon
would in all probability already have them. It just points that the
information was never really safe, all these documents were
probably already \_leaked \_to all those who might have needed
it, and it is just that it wasn't made public, by those sources.

The only people to whom the Wikileaks would have made a difference
to is to the "General Unaware Public". Governments (esp. the US
Govt) does not that they fear the leak but they fear the people
might lose trust in the government, this is the reason they are
still against Wikileaks and not the *leaks*.For it might be this
trust issue that causes them to lose out the support of the people
they currently enjoy.

quote John Naughton of The Guardian </a>

bq.
*What WikiLeaks is really exposing is the extent to which the western democratic system has been hollowed out. In the last decade its political elites have been shown to be incompetent (Ireland, the US and UK in not regulating banks); corrupt (all governments in relation to the arms trade); or recklessly militaristic (the US and UK in Iraq). And yet nowhere have they been called to account in any effective way. Instead they have obfuscated, lied or blustered their way through. And when, finally, the veil of secrecy is lifted, their reflex reaction is to kill the messenger*
<p style="text-align: justify;">
That said I also don't think that Wikileaks will be the messiah of
the right to know of the people, the leaks till now will probably
make the governments to adopt more stringent security measures and
manage to stay ahead of Wikileaks. It might make ten times more
impact than Watergate, but  just like any other scoop it will last
a certain amount of time and then somehow die a silent death, or
else as is said in Dark Knight, Wikileaks would probably die a
hero, or rather live on to give information based on who it
supports and who it opposes, and might even get corrupt. (thanks

Wikileaks has definitely raised the question on "How much have
everyone else already known if Wikileaks can know this much ?", and
my humble request to the governments is
"*If you want to stop the controversy  focus to plugging the leaks rather then pulling the plug of Wikileaks".*
