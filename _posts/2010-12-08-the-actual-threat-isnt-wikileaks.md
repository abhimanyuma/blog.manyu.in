The past few weeks have witnessed a world where the word *wiki* is more likely to be followed by *leaks* than *pedia*. The US and other governments have come out full force against this cyber whistle blower. They have accused them of theft and of putting lives in danger ( *Having blood on their hands* as US Military would like to call it). Yet I believe the threat the governments are facing is not Wikileaks but the fact that it was leakable. 

> If a jewelery store is robbed then the fault lies with the thieves alone, but if someone steals from a military base, the fault lies with both the base, and the thieves.

Wikileaks in its entirety was done by just a group of journalists, and volunteers *who may or may not have hidden connections*. If those people were able to leak such documents which the countries have marked "highly confidential" then how is it that we believe that people with even greater resources for disposal including terrorists, and other nations, have no access to the same documents?  The people in whose hand this information might be a weapon would in all probability already have them. It just points that the information was never really safe, all these documents were
probably already *leaked* to all those who might have needed it, and it is just that it wasn't made public, by those sources.

The only people to whom the Wikileaks would have made a difference to is to the "General Unaware Public". Governments (esp. the US Govt) does not that they fear the leak but they fear the people might lose trust in the government, this is the reason they are still against Wikileaks and not the *leaks*. For it might be this trust issue that causes them to lose out the support of the people they currently enjoy.

To quote John Naughton of The Guardian

> What WikiLeaks is really exposing is the extent to which the western democratic system has been hollowed out. In the last decade its political elites have been shown to be incompetent (Ireland, the US and UK in not regulating banks); corrupt (all governments in relation to the arms trade); or recklessly militaristic (the US and UK in Iraq). And yet nowhere have they been called to account in any effective way. Instead they have obfuscated, lied or blustered their way through. And when, finally, the veil of secrecy is lifted, their reflex reaction is to kill the messenger

That said I also don't think that Wikileaks will be the messiah of the right to know of the people, the leaks till now will probably make the governments to adopt more stringent security measures and manage to stay ahead of Wikileaks. It might make ten times more impact than Watergate, but  just like any other scoop it will last a certain amount of time and then somehow die a silent death, or else as is said in Dark Knight, Wikileaks would probably die a hero, or rather live on to give information based on who it supports and who it opposes, and might even get corrupt.

Wikileaks has definitely raised the question on "How much have everyone else already known if Wikileaks can know this much ?", and my humble request to the governments is
"*If you want to stop the controversy focus to plugging the leaks rather then pulling the plug of Wikileaks".*
