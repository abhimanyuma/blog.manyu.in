Everything that happens, happens for a reason, and today I might have just found one good reason to be happy about legal litigations taking so much of time - “Software Patents”.

Patents were started as a way to protect and encourage the original ideas of an inventor, a patent allows the inventor to safeguard his “product” from others set to steal his thunder. It vested the inventor with the full rights of the “product”, he could now market it on his own, or sell it off at a price or collect royalty according to his wish from the companies that wished to use or sell his product. All this was never done to actually benefit the inventor alone, it had a larger picture to it. Everyone thought that encouraging inventors will result in more inventions and that will take technology forward and as the end result take the society forward. This end result of patents has been highly debated upon, many a times patents have been called as a hindrance to true progress, but with “Software Patents” this whole debate is taken to an entirely new level.

“Software Patents” wouldn't have even existed, had the dumb guys at the Patent offices started giving patents to Industrial Methods, even when they gave it they were thinking of “A process to create cheap aluminium” and things like that. Now just like they do it all the time, so of the best brains who studied law figured out that they could bend this to include software as well, after all software by definition is just a method by which a computer solved a problem, but all this required a physical “product” and they argued that once a software is installed the hardware changes. (The hard disk will write some 1's and 0's and change it's magnetic state). So a software was in fact taking a “product” we all know and existed and creating a “product” that didn't exist till then. **This made software patentable**.

Now you might wonder what is the deal with “Software Patents” but not with anything else, I view software as something abstract, as information which has no existence until it is written down. So in many ways it is similar to a literary work, or music. They have no physical existence of their own and needs a “product” to bring it to life, in the case of a book that happens to be paper, or a screen, and in the case of music, an instrument. Now imagine, if Mark Twain had the idea, and was allowed to patent humour in writing, we wouldn't have had any other writers in his era writing another amazing piece of fiction. Imagine Beethoven being unable to use “Crescendo”, or “Quater Rest”, we wouldn't have had his creations, as beautiful as they were. Just like software one could argue that a piece of literature transforms the book into a new book. So here patents no longer encourage but serve as a means of restraining the ideas. Original ideas are blocked just because they use a part of something that has been used before.

“Software Patents” took the software world and gave it the worst spanking it could, and had litigations been faster, we might see no software company coming up. It forced major companies like Adobe, Microsoft, Apple, Oracle to take patents not to sue others but just to protect itself from other companies which could sue them. The whole thing, turned to a few companies with no software footprint buying a few patents and suing other companies large and small for patent infringement. The best example to this would be that a small investment company brought the patent for a “trade kiosk” which was defined as such “It is a point of sale, whereby the user using his credit card could buy information/products, available at a remote location and use it”. This ended up defining E-Commerce and that company ended up collecting settlement fees from about 100 e-commerce companies. Imagine that has Ada Lovelace patented programming as “A method by which a physical medium can instruct a machine on how the machine has to operate” we wouldn't even have had computer programs.

Now developers would have to go through millions of patents and check if any part of his program was patented, and as most probably it would, he wouldn't be able to develop anything.

I am sure that no one out there wants this, so what I suggest is to do away with software patents totally. If anyone is bothered about Intellectual Property then remember that copyrights exist. It will make sure that the product is protected without putting the idea behind it locked away.

Before I go I have to thank the movie [Patent Absurdity](http://patentabsurdity.com/) for everything in this blog, and also say a thanks to Indian Government for not allowing Software Patents in India.
